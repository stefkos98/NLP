I MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE HERE.
THE NEXT STOP WAS AT THE MUSEUM.
WHAT A DAY FOR A BATHE.
IT'S SOMETHING TO WATCH FOR.
HE ALLOWED FIVE WRONGS AND EIGHT HITS OVER FIVE INNINGS.
I WAS ALL OVER HIM IN THE SECOND SET.
HE'S A DOCTOR OF EVERYTHING.
I HAVE A FEELING THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO BE.
I GO WITH THE FOLLOW.
WELCOME TO THE NEW BOSS.

THAT'S THE WAY IT IS MY SON.
WE HAD ONE DRIVE THE WHOLE GAME FOR SCORE.
THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE.
IT MAKES MORE SENSE THAN GOING TO WAR.
CONGRESS WOULD MAKE THE FINAL DESIGNATION.
SHE KNOWS HE LOVES HER AND SHE LOVES HIM.
PRIDE IN THE COUNTRY WAS ALSO DOWN.
SOMETHING ALWAYS SEEM TO HAPPEN TO HER.
BECAUSE I KNOW I NEED MORE THAN WHAT I HAVE.
IN ORDER TO WORK EFFECTIVELY YOU NEED TO BE ORGANIZE.
CAN WE GET BACK TO THEN.
IT'S A GOOD THING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS LISTENING.
WAS THERE REASON FOR THAT PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF VIEWINGS.
HIT THE HEAD ON THE NAIL.
ABOUT TO GET IN MY BED.
IF HE WANTED TO BE HERE HE WOULD BE.

FRIENDS PLANNED TO VISIT LATER IN THE AFTERNOON.
A MAN APPROACHED THE CAR AND AN EXCHANGE WAS MADE.
SURGERY GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THAT.
WE NEED A NEW COACH.
WE NEED TO GET ON THE BOARD.
I WANT TO ENJOY LIFE.
WHY DO I THINK THE WAY I DO.
SEVERAL HAVE CALLED ME TO DISCUSS THIS.
HAD ONE OF THOSE LAST WEEKEND.
I HAVE TO PUT IT DOWN.
MAYBE THAT SOMEONE WILL BE ME.
WHAT IS GOING ON IN.

THEY COULD NOT HELP BUT NOTICE.
AND WE KNOW THAT WE ARE LOVED.
THAT'S THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO WORK.
DOCTORS HAVE NOT SET A DATE FOR HIS DISCHARGE.
THEIR CHILD'S DEATH IS NOT IN VAIN.
THIS IS A STEP BACKWARDS FOR US.
JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO MIX THINGS UP A BIT.
THIS WILL BE SO GOOD.
BUT BACK TO NORMAL NOW.
I THOUGHT I HAD LOST MY PHONE.
WANT TO TALK ABOUT TO WORK.
WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.
I HAD A GREAT DAY.
DO I REALLY WANT TO STILL.
SHOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY HANDLE IT.
HOW WAS I TO KNOW.
HE PUT A SMILE ON MY FACE TONIGHT.
IT REMAINS THE STANDARD THE RULE THE TERM OF COMPARISON.
I GLANCE OVER AT THE DOOR.
THIS WAR IS OVER EXISTENCE.
LIGHTING A FIRE IS AN EASY WAY TO GET FOUND.
AT LEAST NOT FOR NOW.
I WAS PROBABLY FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF MORE THAN ANYTHING.
THAT'S A LOT MORE COMPLICATED.
THANKS FOR THE JOY OF OWNERSHIP.
WALKED IN THE PARK TODAY.
WE WISH YOU COULD BE TOO.
CAN YOU PUT A STOP TO THIS MADNESS.
NO YOU GO TO BED.
I KNOW HOW TO PROGRAM.
BOOK A PARTY WITH A DIFFERENCE.
GUN DEATH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST.
WE ARE SO HAPPY TO HAVE HELPED.
THIS WAS ONLY THE START OF THE TRAIL.
TODAY I HAVE SO MUCH TO BE THANKFUL FOR.
THANK YOU FOR THE POINTS.
WE WERE ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING AS IT WAS.
DRIVE THE CAR WOULD YOU.
THE REBELS HAD COME UPON HIS LAND.
I LOST BY ONE VOTE.
SHE WAS AMONG THE DEAD.
PLANS WERE BEING MADE FOR A MEMORIAL SERVICE.
THEY BEAT US ON THE FIELD.
THIS IS A NATURAL PART OF LIFE.
MAYBE I WILL BE SAFE.
TOGETHER WE WILL DO THIS.
DECIDE TO LIVE IN A BEAUTIFUL STATE.
HOPE IT'S JUST A EUROPE ISSUE.
WHAT ARE YOU HOPING TO GAIN.
YES IT WAS AN INTERESTING HOUSE.
THANK YOU FOR THE ASSIST.
NOT THAT KIND OF STORY.
WAS IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE.
DO YOU HAVE A BATHROOM.
QUESTION IS WHERE DO YOU LAND.
IT WAS ABOUT THAT PLAN OF ESCAPE.
HE TAPPED ON THE GLASS.
THEY USED TO BEAT US TO STEAL OUR BRUSHES.
I REMEMBER THAT SOME BUT STILL NOTHING OF HER.
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT NEVER HAPPENED TO US BEFORE.
IT'S STILL THERE FOR ME.
BUT THOSE ARE NOT MY DECISIONS.
SHOULD BE A WAKE UP CALL.
WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT DREAMS.
AS PART OF THE RUN UP TO RELEASE.
TRUST ME THERE IS PLENTY OF BREAD.
OFTEN NOT SO EASY TO DO.
UNTIL YOU SIT AND LISTEN TO IT.
DO YOU HAVE THE GLASSES.
GLAD YOU ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME.
WINDOWS OPEN TRANSFORMERS IN BED.
BEST TWO MONTHS OF THE YEAR.
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE SO EASY TO DRAW.
THERE WERE TWO NEW LIVES IN THE HOUSE.
BUT HE WOULD NOT LET ME GO.
PREDICTION IS AS CLEAR AS DAY IS IT NOT.
GO AND GET READY IF YOU WANT TO COME.
WHAT WAS SO SPECIAL ABOUT THIS SONG.
I KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
THE RACE IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL.
IT CAN ONLY CONTINUE TO GROW.
EVERYONE MIGHT AS WELL GET READY FOR IT.
WAKE UP AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO GROW.
MENTALLY READY FOR A FULL DAY OF TRAVEL.
IT'S WAY TOO MUCH FOR ME ALREADY.
SOMETIMES THE TRUTH IS DISGUSTING.
DRIVING TO THE MOON IN STYLE.
ALL THE BEST FOR THE MOVIE.
PLEASE GO BACK TO THE STARS SYSTEM.
AT THE END OF THE DAY EVERYBODY LOST.
KNOW ANYONE THAT WOULD BE A GOOD CANDIDATE.
WHEN ARE YOU WORKING WITH AGAIN.
COULD YOU SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN SOON.
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE.
DO NOT FEAR TO GIVE YOURSELF TO ME.
SHE STEPPED INTO THE PASSAGE.
I NEVER TO SEE THEM AGAIN.
FEAR MUST HAVE TURNED MY HEAD.
I HAD HOPED TO DO BETTER.
NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS A CROSS THERE.
HE WILL BE EXPECTED TO IMPROVE IN BOTH AREAS.
STRESS AFTER ALL IS THE ROOT OF DISEASE.
I WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE WITH YOU.
INTERESTED TO GET YOUR TAKE.
I WILL BE AT WORK TOMORROW.
FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION SUCCESS IS JUST A PROCESS.
ANY REPORTS ON THE CONTENTS OF THE PIE.
MAN PILLAR IS THE BEST.
FACTS ARE OF NO IMPORTANCE TO THEM.
MAYBE IT'S THE SAME MENU.
LOVE COMING TO THE BRAVES GAME.
UNLUCKY NOT TO GO ON AND WIN THE GAME TODAY.
WE HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE FINDING YOU.
OH HE'S A NICE MAN IS YOUR FATHER.
THAT WAS WHY WE SHIFTED.
HERE IT IS YOU SEE SIR.
HENCE THE CYCLE OF THE GAMES IS BRIEF.
I TURNED AND THE FRENCH WINDOW WAS OPEN BEHIND ME.
A LOT OF PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT ROLE.
BUT THE SITUATION WAS ALSO UNCOMFORTABLE.
THE TEARS WERE JUST RUNNING OUT OF MY EYES.
FOR HER IT'S PRAISE.
YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.
I WAS TRYING TO FORGET.
I GET SOME OF THE CRITICISM.
THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE BEST MOVIE EVER.
I DO IT FOR US.
WHICH WAS A STUPID THING TO DO.
MAJORITY OF THE DAY WITH MY LOVE.
THEY ARE STILL VERY MUCH U S CITIZENS.
THANKS TO ALL WHO VOTED FOR US IN THE AWARDS.
VERY IMPORTANT VICTORY WE ARE ON THE RIGHT WAY.
GOING TO DO SOME WORK IN A BIT.
I LEAVE THE HOUSE IN THE DARK.
THAT WAS A GREAT CHAPTER.
ALL I CAN DO IS SIT BACK AND LAUGH.
AND THE ANSWER IS YES.
MARK IS A BAD CORRESPONDENT.
JIM WENT TO SEE KANGAROO.
LANA CAN PAINT THE BIRD.
THREE FOUR TWO EIGHT.
TWO ONE ONE SEVEN.
NINE SIX THREE SEVEN.
FIVE SIX ONE ONE.
SEVEN NINE ZERO.
LYNDA LOVES THE NEW SANDALS.
LOOK AT TINA'S SHIRT.
SO LAYLA WENT INTO THE BANK.
ELSA WAS WALKING TO SCHOOL.
THEN JIM WALK TO ART ROOM.
THAT'S MY BRAVE LITTLE MOUNTAIN CLIMBER.
CAN I KEEP THEM.
I HAVE A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU.
I HAD TWO SISTERS.
I WISH WE HAVE A LIGHT.
BUT NOT USE GOING OVER THAT.
HE WOULD GO OUT BUT WHEN.
YOU HAVE NO IDEAS HAVE YOU.
I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY SIMPLE.
I THINK THE KEY WORD IS PROBABLY.
THERE WAS NO RECORD OF ADOPTION.
I WANT TO WIN IT VERY MUCH.
NOT THE SAME BUT IT IS DELICIOUS.
LET'S TRY AND MAKE IT TO THE NEXT ROUND.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO GET BETTER.
IT'S THE PERFECT TIME TO GET READY FOR THE BEACH.
ANY HOPE FOR IT IN THE FUTURE.
LOVE THE IDEA OF IT ALL.
SO AS SOON AS THAT HAPPENS.
AND THERE IS NO ANSWER.
WE WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE GAME.
TIGERS ARE ON THE BOARD.
UNTIL THEN YOU ARE BLOCKED.
ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT.
AND WHO IS THE JUDGE.
I'D LOVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT ONE.
BECAUSE WHY WOULD ANYBODY CHOOSE TO BE UNHAPPY.
HIS FIRST BOW TO THE PUBLIC.
SO THAT IS PROBABLY AN UPPER LIMIT.
THE ONLY THING HAVE TO PAY IS ATTENTION.
YOU ALL IN MY PRAYERS.
ARE YOU NOT GOING TO TOUR.
WHAT A GREAT FRIDAY EVENING.
GLAD YOU LIKE THE SONG.
THIS WOULD BE MY LAST WISH.
PARKING WOULD SEEM TO ISSUE.
WE NEED TO PRAY BADLY.
INTERESTING FIRST HALF OF GAMES.
I HAVE NOTHING BUT UTMOST RESPECT FOR YOU.
WHO'S GOING TO APRIL PARTY.
OF COURSE YOU CAN SEEM.
AND WHAT WILL YOU DO TO GET THERE.
I WAS SO PROUD OF MYSELF.
HER MOTHER WHO HAD MADE HER WAS NO HUMAN.
COME TO THE HOUSE AND STAY.
THERE'S NOTHING THAT UNUSUAL ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN.
WILL FIND THIS OUT SOME DAY.
I WILL GO AND LOOK FOR IT.
IT MADE ME FEEL GOOD.
ONLY THE BOATS ARE ARMED LIGHTLY.
IT'S NOT GOING TO KILL THEM.
YET ALL IT TAKES IS THREE TWO ONE.
SATURDAY WINNING COLORS WILL BECOME THE SECOND.
EVERYONE CAN WIN AT HOME.
STILL ONE OF MY FEARS.
IF YOU NEED A REMINDER.
THE SPRING MARKET IS STRONG.
SURE IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE.
IT'S NICE TO GET BACK INTO IT AGAIN.
BLUE WAS READY TO GO.
HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON WITH YOUR BIKE.
WE HAVE TO MAKE A STAND NOW.
MY HOME IS IN THE STARS.
IT IS MY LOVE THAT IS BOLD.
WAS HE NOT HAPPY TOO.
WE NEITHER OF US KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT.
THERE WAS ALWAYS A DAY WHEN SHE CALLED TIME.
THEY BOTH LAUGHED AND FOR A LONG TIME.
INSURANCE IS A MAJOR CONSIDERATION IN MOVING.
HE KNOWS BETTER THAN TO TELL ME ABOUT THOSE THINGS.
AFTER THAT COMES THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD.
THE DANGERS OF HANGING OUT IN PUBLIC PLACES.
SO YOU SHOULD BE FINE.
THEY HAVE HAD THEIR CHANCE FOR MONTHS.
POP IT ON THE LIST.
SO YOU KNOW THE USUAL.
SEEING YOU LIKE THIS IS NOT PRETTY.
NOTHING BETTER THAN A DAY AT THE BEACH.
IT'S UP TO YOU TO MAKE SURE THEY NEVER FORGET.
YOU WILL BE THERE IN SPIRIT.
PLEASE KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ME.
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET A HOLD OF YOU.
IT'S AS STEADY AS A ROCK.
WHEN SHE LOOKED UP SHE BEAMED.
THE TRAIL THOUGH WOULD BE EXTENSIVE.
A THOUSAND YEARS AGO IT SEEMED.
BUT ONLY IF SHE COULD HANDLE THE HEAT.
AS IF SHE WANTED HIM TO LEAVE.
BUT WE WOULD ASK MORE OF YOU.
THAT'S WHY IT IS SO DIFFICULT.
BUT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.
WE MIGHT GET BEAT AND WE MIGHT WIN.
THEY ALL LIVED IN THE SAME STREET.
YOU KNOW THIS COULD BE TRUE.
TAG A FRIEND YOU WISH YOU WERE HERE WITH.
FASHION IS IN A TERRIBLE STATE.
IT'S A BIT OF A FEAR FOR ME THAT.
HOW ABOUT THIS FOR A CHANGE.
THAT WAY PEOPLE WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT LIVE.
I THINK WE SHOULD GET HIM ON THE SHOW.
I MAY STILL BE TIRED.
VIDEO ABOUT THE NEW LOCATION.
REMEMBER THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL.
MATCH OF THE YEAR SO FAR.
I THINK IT IS TIME.
KEEPING MY HAND IN MY POCKET.
SHE WANTS TO GET CAUGHT.
BUT HOW MANY WILL NEVER SEE IT.
THE MAN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HAD A BROWN JACKET.
SOME WORKERS WERE BACK ON THE JOB.
THEY WOULD NOT STAND FOR IT.
SOMEBODY WHO CAN HIT HOME RUNS AND DRIVE IN RUNS.
HE PROBABLY IS THE MOST TALENTED IN THE SECONDARY.
IF THERE WERE GAMES WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM THEM.
I WAS WATCHING BACK AND FIRTH BACK AND FIRTH.
MANY OF THE TROOPS WERE BADLY BURNED.
I JUST WANTED TO PLAY STEADY.
ANIMAL KINGDOM DAY AND NIGHT.
WHAT A GREAT SUNDAY MORNING.
THEY HAD A GOOD SEASON.
QUICK CHANGE HOW DO YOU DO IT.
GOING TO TRY AND MAKE IT.
FIRST GAME DAY OF THE YEAR.
WE ARE IN THE BACK.
I READ A LOT OF FICTION.
EDGE OF TOMORROW IS GOOD TIME.
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.
HERE'S THE GREAT MAN HIMSELF.
I AM SO SORRY TO ALL OF YOU.
THE OTHERS WERE TREATED IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM.
HE MAY HAVE ALREADY STARTED.
THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO APPROACH IT I THINK.
HE SHOULD HAVE LET THE ORGANIZATION AND THE MANAGER KNOW.
WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW THEY ARE SPECIAL.
GOING TO ANY OTHER GAMES.
I MADE IT TO THE FINALE.
CERTAINLY YOU CAN BE MORE SPECIFIC.
HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU SPEND DOING.
BUT NO NEED FOR THAT NOW.
I WAS ABLE TO DEFEND AGAINST IT SUCCESSFULLY.
HOPE SHE HAD A GOOD DAY MATE.
PLANTS GROW TO THE SIZE OF THE POT.
THAT KID HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
IT WAS PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.
THIS IS NO FANCY SKETCH BUT THE TRUTH.
SHE WAS LARGE AND SHE WAS KIND.
THUS FAR THEREFORE ALL WAS WELL.
THE HOUSE WAS VERY STILL.
ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK.
AS OF MONDAY MORNING THE POST IS STILL UP.
THAT'S A LONG WAY TO RUN.
THERE WAS NO REQUEST MADE FOR THE GUARD TODAY.
HE'S HONEST TO BE THE BONE.
INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE EVENTS I PRODUCE.
WELL TIME FOR ME TO GO TO SLEEP.
ALCOHOL IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER.
PUMPED FOR THE RETURN OF THE KING TODAY.
IT SHOULD BE A GOOD NIGHT.
SO THIS SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY BIG DEAL.
SEE ALL I HAD TO DO WAS COMPLAIN.
SPIRITUAL FORMATION IS NOT SOMETHING WE MASTER.
WINNING IS SO MUCH FUN.
BLESS SUGAR RAY AND HIS FAMILY.
HANGING OUT AT THE BEACH.
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE UNIVERSE.
IT IS NOW TWO O'CLOCK.
HE WAS TWENTY WHEN HE LEARNED THE TRUTH ABOUT HIMSELF.
I WISH YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THESE TWO LETTERS.
MORE SNOW WAS IN THE FORECAST FOR MONDAY NIGHT.
IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT NECESSARY.
TODAY THEY ARE MORE DYNAMIC AND MORE HUMANE.
OTHERS ARE NOT QUITE SO SURE HOWEVER.
THEY ARE SO DEEP IN TALENT.
EACH TEAM STARTS AT THE SAME TIME.
BUT I SAW IT AGAIN.
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOCCER.
BACK AND AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE ARE.
STILL WAITING FOR IT TO HAPPEN.
LOOKS TO BE WORTH THE WAIT.
FEELS SO GOOD TO BE BACK TOGETHER.
LISTEN TO IT IN ALL ITS GLORY.
MASKS ARE PART OF UNIFORM.
WHEN IS IT TIME TO TALK ABOUT GUNS.
THIS IS NOT A NICE STORY IT'S TRUE.
WE SHOULD TOTALLY GO FOR A WALK.
BUT THEY MUST DO IT.
AND NOW IT'S MY TURN.
THERE MAY BE A WAY TO CHANGE ALL THAT.
NOW HE'S OPEN HE CAN SELL IT TO YOU.
IT WAS A NEW MARKET.
COULD YOU PUT HIM ON THE BOARD.
HE WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE PARTY THERE.
SO THEY HAVE TO GO WITH MORE SOPHISTICATE POSITIONING.
BUT IS NOT NOW.
NOW BECAUSE OF DRAGONS LOOK WHERE HE IS TODAY.
THERE IS ALWAYS THE QUESTION OF WHAT WILL FOLLOW.
THE ECONOMY IS FAR FROM SOUND.
KEEP IN TOUCH HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND.
I MEAN IT WAS THE LAST SUPPER.
WELL THANKS FOR THE CONSIDERATION.
HE ALWAYS KNOWS HOW TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
IT'S WEDNESDAY YOU KNOW THE DRILL.
ENOUGH OF THE TIME LOOP.
IT IS SUCH A GOOD FIRM.
AT FIRST HE COULD NOT SPEAK.
AND NOW I GO DOWN TO LOOK AT IT.
SHE WAS BROAD AT THIS SHOULDERS.
THREE AND FOUR ARE THE BEST.
HE AND HIS PARENTS SAY THEY ARE NO LONGER SPEAKING.
ENOUGH OF THE TECHNICAL STUFF.
WE ALL KNOW THIS IS A TOUGH RACE TRACK.
YOU MUST HAVE A LOT.
BUT I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.
THIS WOULD BE A VERY BUSY DAY.
I COME FROM A FAMILY OF TEACHERS.
SORRY FOR BEING A PLASTIC.
WHAT DO YOU SAY THE MOST.
WHAT AND HOW DO YOU SING.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO BE READY TO PLAY.
DO YOU LIKE THE COLOR OF THE SKY.
WHY IN THE WORLD AM I NOT IN THE BED.
IT'S SUNDAY NIGHT NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.
AND IN A SENSE YOU WERE RIGHT.
AND IT IS MY OWN HAND.
AS FOR THE FINAL THREE.
HE STARED AT THE STUDENTS.
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO BUT GET DRUNK.
THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL.
YOU TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT THOSE KIND OF THINGS.
IT'S A VICTORY LAP FOR ME.
JUST WONDERING WHAT TO DO WITH THE CAT.
AND WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED SO FAR.
COULD NOT BE SO PROUD.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.
LOT MORE TO LIFE THAN FOOTBALL.
HI ANGEL YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
WAIT YOU CAN SEE THAT CAN YOU.
HOPELESSNESS IS A GREAT SIGH.
IT WAS SO GREAT TO SEE EVERYONE.
THEY TALK A LOT OF SENSE.
IT'S NOT AS SWEET WHEN YOU HAVE TO SHARE.
A LIGHT IN THE SHADOW.
HOPE TO SEE MUCH MORE OF YOU.
GREAT FIRST GAME OF THE SEASON.
IT USED TO BE CALLED A HAPPY ENDING.
AND I GET TO HEAR A LOT OF IT.
IT WAS A GREAT FUN.
HE RUNS HE BLOCKS HE CATCHES THE BALL.
WE HAVE THE EARLY SIGNS.
ON SUNDAY NONE OF THAT COUNTED FOR ANYTHING.
PEOPLE ARE GETTING BACK TO WORK.
IT SHOW THE WEAKNESS OF THE MOVEMENTS.
IN A WORLD CUP GAIN.
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT YOU HAVE TO OFFER.
I HAVE A NEW THING ON THE FRIDGE.
TIME TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE FOR A WHILE.
YOU TALKED YOU CAUGHT YOU SCORED.
WHAT TO EAT IF YOU HAVE NO MONEY.
YOU SHOULD KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THEM.
LOOKING FOR A GOOD GIFTS.
JOY CAN BE HARD TO FIND SOMETIMES.
I WILL NOT HESITATE TO CALL THE POLICE.
THE HOUSE WAS TOO BIG.
THE TOP OF ITS HEAD WAS STILL OPEN.
THE DOOR WAS OPENED WITH DIFFICULTY.
HE MARKED THEIR PROGRESS ON THE CHART.
BUT PERHAPS FOR HIM IT WAS NOT TOO LATE.
IT WOULD BE QUITE A CHALLENGE.
IT'S SORT A BIT A LITTLE BIT FORWARD AND BACK.
AND THANK YOU FOR BEING SO STRONG.
FOUND THIS IN THE COLLECTION.
HE IS IN THE HOSPITAL.
PROOF WE HAVE A GOOD TIME.
VIA WHAT DO YOU THINK.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHOCOLATE.
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOU.
WEIGHT IS THE ENEMY OF PERFORMANCE.
WHATEVER THE DIFFICULTY THERE'S A SOLUTION.
PRAYER IS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH AND SPIRIT.
I KNOW HOW TO DO ALL OF THEM.
BUT LOOK AT MY PARENTS.
TEXT ME IF YOU SINGLE SINGE.
HOPE WE GET TO SEE MORE.
THAT A HAT WAS NOT NECESSARY.
IT WAS ALL FOR YOU THAT I THOUGHT.
LOOK BOY VIOLENCE IS THE RESORT OF THE VIOLENT.
WHY AM I A GHOST.
DO I TAKE YOU WITH ME.
WHY NOT DO AS SHE WISHED.
SHE WAS NOT HERE.
HAVE YOU SOMETHING TO SAY.
DO YOU NOT NOW YEAH KNOW IT.
SHE IS HIS MOTHER.
AND THEY WERE RIGHT.
DO NOT GO THERE MY LOVE.
I KNOW THAT HE IS SURE OF IT.
TAKE ME WITH YOU.
EVERY ONE LOVES HER.
IT'S WAS A WARM MORNING AFTER RAIN.
I WANT TO JOINING ON.
THIS WAS HER WORK.
SHE WOULD HAVE LOVED YOU.
I KNOW THE NAME TOO.
I DO KNOW OF ONE NOW.
CAN YOU GUESS HIS NAME.
THEY LOVED HER AND SHE LOVED THEM.

SHE LOOKED AS THE CLOCK.

THERE COMES ONE OF THEM.
THIS IS WHY IT DOES SO.
I AM NOT A POLICEMAN.
BUT HERE HE COMES AGAIN.
TELL HER SO WITH MY LOVE.
WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IT.
I TAKE PEOPLE YOU KNOW AS I FIND THEM.
IT WOULD DO YOU A LOT OF GOOD.
I HEAR THE DOCTOR'S HORSE.
I AM LISTENING TO YOU.
I PLAY WITH IT AFTER SCHOOL.
AND SO IT IS WITH ALL OF US.
THEN HEAR THEM FATHER.
THERE YOU ARE THEN.
HE TURN BACK TO HIS WATCH.
WAS THERE ANY US.
HE WILL HELP ME FIND A ROOM.
WILL YOU TEA TELL HIM.
I DO NOT WISH TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
IT IS OVER ALREADY.
WE WERE ALL SURE OF THAT.
IS THIS WELL DONE.
BUT CARE CARE CARE.
IT IS ONLY FOUR FEET HIGH.
HE ONLY WRITES TO TELL ME A PLACE OF NEWS.
WHAT WOMAN WHO REALLY LOVED WOULD.
TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD DO.
WHY WOULD YOU WRITE TO ME.
BUT IT'S A REALLY NICE PRISON SO.
AND HE'S NOT IN LOVE WITH ME.
ONE OF THEM TURNED ON HIM.
AUTHORITIES CLAIMS THAT THE KILLINGS WERE THE CRIME OF ANGER.
THE CASE IS STILL ON APPEAL.
I CALL UPON CONGRESS TO DO THIS IMMEDIATELY.
HURT A CANCER THINGS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.
WHAT A DREAM COME TRUE THAT WOULD BE.
BASKET IT A LITTLE SMALL.
THE IDEA THAT THERE IS A LARGE NO.
THIS IS ALL SORTS OF DUMB.
I WAS ALL THE WAY IN FRONT.
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT AFFECTS US.
I DO MY BEST WORK ON THE FLOOR.
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE FOR ME.
WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT TEA.
YET SHE LOVED HIM IN SPITE OF IT ALL.
YET HE WAS AFRAID TO ACT.
HE COULD NOT UNDERTAKE TO LIVE ON THAT.
BUT THE LETTER WAS NEVER FOR HIM.
AND THIS FROM ME.

HE LOOK UP WITH AN IDEA IN HIS EYES.
YES THAT MAY BE.
BUT GO ON AND LET ME HEAR YOU.
TELL ME AFTER WHAT.
I THOUGHT HE WAS A BRILLIANT MAN.
A CIVIL SUIT AGAINST THE COUNTY IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY.
IN SPIRITUAL TERMS IT WAS A PRIVILEGE.
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
NO NEED TO GIVE THE ANSWERS THEN.
SECURITY AROUND THE HOTEL IS TIGHT.
ALTHOUGH HE HAD ONLY A.
FINAL RACE OF THE SEASON TODAY.
WE ARE THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR.
I LACK THE ABILITY TO GRASP THE CONCEPT OF TIME.
I NEED TO BE LOVED.
I HAVE TO LIVE WITH ME.
BUT THEN YOU COULD BE IN JAIL.
I WANT TO SEE YOU MAN.
THAT IS THE LAST TIME.
TOO LATE TO GO TO THE STORE.
I CAN HELP YOU WITH THE WEIGHT LOSS.
WHY ARE YOU GOING TO GET ONE.
I WAS GRATEFUL TO HER.
BECAUSE I CAN KEEP YOU SAFE.

ASK HIM TO LOOK IN AND SEE ME.
THERE WAS A GREAT SURPRISE IN HER FACE ALSO.
GO AWAY AND LEAVE ME.
GO AWAY FROM THE TABLE.
WAS IT IN SIX HOURS THAT THE FRENCH WERE COMING.

CAN THIS TALE BE TRUE.
COME COME THIS WON'T DO.
YOUR FATHER WAS MY FRIEND.
THE FIRST DAY OF THE WAKE IS NOTHING TO IT.
I SHALL GO AND LOOK FOR SOME MONEY.
WHAT BILLS WILL THAT PAY.
SHE FOLLOWED AND LOOKED.
THE MONKEY CAN'T TAKE IT HOME.
BUT WHO ELSE WAS TO DO IT.
DO THEY BEGIN TO FORGET US.
BUT NOW THEY WERE PARTED.
IT WAS QUITE A FAMILY PARTY.
I ALSO SOON LEARNED THE WAY TO BE HUNGRY.
AND SHALL I TELL YOU WHY.
AH I COULD SEE IT.
I HAD BETTER GO ON WITH THE STORY.
I'M GOOD FOR TWENTY YEARS.
I HAVE DONE AS WELL AS I COULD.
WE SHALL HAVE THE BEST OF EVERYTHING.
AND HOW COULD HE.
BUT COULD YOU MAKE IT SO.
I'M TIRED OF IT.
WHAT COULD I DO.
IN HALF AN HOUR THE DOCTOR WOULD BE BACK.
WELL I WILL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW.
THEY WILL BEGIN TO KNOW THEMSELVES FOR WHAT THEY ARE.
I THINK THE SHAKING HURT HIS FEELINGS VERY MUCH.
VERY GOOD FOR TRAVELERS.
THEIR LOOKS WERE BIG WITH SOME IMPORTANT NEWS.
WE SHALL NEVER SEE YOU FACE HERE AGAIN.
WE HAD BECOME WELL USE TO THE CLOTHES.
I SHALL NEVER BE WHAT HE WAS.
THE MORNING THAT WE PARTED TOO.
THE DOCTOR ASKED LEAVE TO SAY ONE WORD MORE.
AFTER LUNCH SHE READS NEWSPAPERS.
WITH MY OWN HAND.
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.
ELSE WHY SHOULD WE COME.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF DAD.
YOU'RE A NICE WOMAN.
NOT THE SEA SURELY.
SHALL I JUMP OUT.
OF THESE THREE ALL DAUGHTERS LIVED TO GROW UP.
MOTHER AND SON TALKED TOGETHER.
AND WITHOUT ANY MORE GROUNDS.
SHE OPEN THE WINDOW EAT.
FINE FIND FINE COULD BE ONLY BE.
YOUR DAUGHTER LOVES ME.
WEST IS THE NAME.
THESE ARE THINGS WHICH A MAN CANNOT FORGET.
ALONE IN HIS ROOM.
WE ARE BORN COUSINS.
I'M GLAD BECAUSE I LOVE DRIVING.
THEN EACH LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW.
NOTHING BUT GOOD FROM THIS.
NOW HE WAS GOING AWAY.
YOU MAY TAKE HER OR LEAVE HER.
THEY WERE NEVER AN HOUR ALONE.
BUT A GREAT STRONG MAN.
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO GIVE ME THEIR MONEY.
IT WAS FAR FAR AWAY BY THIS TIME.
AND THE THREE TURNED AWAY.
YOU HAVE DONE THAT WHICH MUST MAKE A FATHER ANGRY.
THE LITTLE MAN WAS DOING THE SAME FOR ME.
SHALL YOU TURN ME OUT.
WELL THAT WAS TRUE IN PART.
AND LOOKING UP HE SAW HIM.
I MUST WASH MY HANDS FIRST.
BUT WHAT A CAPITAL WORLD IT IS.
HE MUST LEAVE HIS MONEY TO SOMEBODY.
I MUST DO SOMETHING FOR MY LIVING.
THEY CAN ONLY GO BACK ON THEMSELVES.
THE GREAT WORK IT SHALL BE CARRY ON.
YOU SHALL GO WITH HIM.
HOW COULD SHE LIVE AND WHAT WOULD SHE DO.
I DON'T KNOW THEM.
WE ARE NOT TOO LATE.
THAT THEY COULD NOT TELL US.
THEN SHALL WE LIVE.
IT IS YOU WHO MUST GO.
LET ME READ IT TO YOU.
HOW WAS SHE TO TAKE ANY PRESENT FROM HIM NOW.
BUT YOU MUST NOT FORGET ME.
I NEVER PART WITH THEM.
I MUST HAVE IT.
I ASKED FOR NOTHING.
I SHALL HAVE THINGS TO SAY.
BUT I SHALL SPEAK OF HER AGAIN.
WHY IS IT TOO LATE.
YOU HAVE HAD YOUR OWN WAY.
YOU SHALL NOT BE THE ONE TO GO.
WHAT ELSE COULD ONE SAY.
SHE WANTED TO SEE HIS FACE AGAIN.
DON'T LET GO MY HAND.
NO CLOTHES NO MONEY.
YOU LIKE YOUR ART BETTER THAN YOU FRIENDS.
IT HAS PASSED INTO OTHER HANDS NOW.
NOTHING FOR NOTHING YOUNG MAN.
HIS MIND WAS BUSY.
I CAN'T BE DIFFERENT.
HIS FACE WAS COLD.
COULD YOU BEAR IT.
FOR A TIME HE COULD NOT FIND WORDS.
WHO ELSE SAYS SO.
I'M NOT BIG ENOUGH.
OUR MEETING COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED BETTER.
THEN THE STORY WAS FINISHED.
I LIKE TO MEET HIM.
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND DRIVING.
I HAD LEARNED WHAT I NEEDED.
NEVER AGAIN COULD SHE CLOSE THEM.
BUT THEY MUST BE NICE ONES LIKE YOURS YOU KNOW.
MEET ME HERE AT THE SAME HOUR TOMORROW.
AT THAT TIME TOO OF ALL OTHERS.
HIS OWN GIRL MIND YOU.
IT WAS PART OF OUR WORK.
IN THE AFTERNOON I SAW HIM.
AND I DON'T ALWAYS TRY.
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE THERE IN MY FAMILY.
I CANNOT ASK YOU.
COULD IT SEE HIM.
WHERE MUST I GO.
LOOK AT MY FACE.
HERE IT IS AND YOU CAN READ FOR YOURSELF.
SHE HAD NOT AGAIN I LEARNED TO LOVE HER COUSIN.
YOU MUST DO YOU BEST.
SHE WAS ALONE HIS LIGHT LOST.
AND CAN YOU TEACH ME THEN.
I SURE GET MY HAND OUT.
BUT YOU SHALL LISTEN TO ME.
BUT THERE WERE OTHERS ALSO PRESENT.
BUT YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT.
NO ONE SAW IT FOR A MOMENT OR SO.
I HAVE LIVED IN THE PLACE.
WHEN COULD WE DO IT.
SHE IS BETTER OFF THAN I CAN MAKE HER.
BUT SHE COULD NEVER BE CROSS WITH HIM.
HE WOULD BE GOING AWAY.
FOR AN HOUR THEY WALKED AND TALKED.
AND NOW GO AWAY.
YOU MAY SAY THAT TURNED.
THEN SHE WAS LEFT ALONE.
WHAT IS BIG AND WHAT IS LITTLE.
AND YOU'RE THE SAME MAN TOO.
SHE COULD NOT FACE IT.
YOU SHALL SOON HAVE HER BACK.
I COULD NEVER LOVE YOU AGAIN.
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY.
WAS IT NOT BY HIS DONE WILL.
WHO WOULD HAVE BROKEN THE NEWS TO THE FATHER.
I SHOULD CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE.
FATHER IS ALONE YOU WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU.
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT.
SHE TURNED ROUND AS THEY ENTERED.
THE VOICE CAME FROM ABOVE THEM.
HE IS MADE SO AS NOT TO BE AFRAID.
WHAT WHAT DID HE WANT THERE.
THAT'S WAS THE DIFFERENCE.
THERE WHERE NO MEANS OF DOING IT.
BUT SUCH IS THE WAY ALL THE GREAT.
THEY ALL SAID GOODBYE.
I DID MYSELF SO I KNOW WHAT THIS LIKE.
I WENT OUT LAST.
WOMEN SAY THOSE THINGS BUT NEVER DO THEM.
THESE VISITED SHE RETURNED.
IT IS SO NATURE IS MADE.
AS I COULD.
SOME OF THE MEN WHERE TALKING AWAY THE TABLES.
MY DAUGHTER YOU MUST RETURN TO YOUR PLACE.
IT WAS MY LAST WEEK THERE.
HE LOOKED AROUND HIM AND BEGAN.
THE OTHER HAVE ALL RETURN.
AND HE WENT BACK FOR MORE.
FOR THESE HE TOOK THE MONEY.
WHAT DID YOU NOT LET ASK KNOW.
IT OFTEN HAPPENS SO IN LIFE.
BUT YOU SIDE JUST NOW.
WHAT IS THERE SUCH A PLACE.
I HAD HIT HIM AT LEST.
LET US GO SET SHOE.
HE STOPPED IN HIS WALK AND LOOKED AROUND.
SHE CAME UP TO MY WITH MY SISTER.
SHE DID EVERYTHING SO WELL.
HE THEN WENT AWAY.
AND SO HER LIFE WAS ONE OF LOVE.
LITTLE BY LITTLE THE BOYS BEGAN TALKING AGAIN.
SHE MAY BE PHONE.
SHE WENT BACK INTO THE LIE LIBRARY.
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME ABOUT.
WERE STAY AT NINE.
DECIDE IT WHO CAN I CANNOT.
HE KIT ME BY THE ARM.
FOURTEEN FEEL AWAY AND THAT LEFT ONE.
HOW COULD SHE HAVE THOUGHT THEM.
NOW IT CAME TO ME.
BUT HE THOUGHT BETTER OF IT.
THEY HAD NO ENOUGH SPORT FOR ONE DAY.
VERY WELL I HAVE NO MORE QUESTIONS TO ASK.
I TOOK MY HEAD IN MY HANDS AND THOUGHT.
AFTER A TIME HE TOOK UP HIS STORY.
WHAT MORE DID SHE SAY.
GOT THAT HAVE YOU.
HE DID IT FOR ME.
THAT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
I PASS HALF MY LIFE IN THE WOODS.
DO I NEED TO TELL YOU THAT I WONDER.
OF COURSE I KNOW THAT ALL THIS IS VERY SERIOUS.
HISTORY IT IS NOT.
THE PRETTY NURSE LOOKED QUITE SORRY.
HE TOOK UP A BOOK.
MEN HOPED AND WERE AFRAID TO HOPE.
AND DID YOU HEAR NOTHING.
EVERYONE STARTED WITH SURPRISE.
WHY BREAK EVERY TIE.
THE CHILDREN PRESENTLY RETURNED.
THE GIRL STOPED SHORT.
OR WHY DID NOT JOB GO.
THE HAND JUST WHERE HE WISHED.
PROUD OLD FAMILIES I GUESS.
CAMPED AT OUR OLD PLACE.
AND THEN MY AUNT USE TO CRY.
SHE STAMPS HER FOOT.
OUR TRIP BEGAN BADLY.
WOULD SHE WIN HIM.
KNOWING CAME BY SEEING.
PRESENTLY THE SNOW CAME.
LIVELY NOW LIVELY MEN.
THREE MEN IN RED COAT CAME.
THE BOX WAS LARGE AND IMPORTANT NEAR THE STAGE.
I WENT TO THE SEA WORLD TO SEE BEAUTIFUL FISHES.
ALL MEN JUMPPED THEIR HANDS.
AN EXAMPLE MUST BE MADE.
MINUTE AFTER MINUTE WENT BY.
WE CANNOT TAKE FROM THEM WHAT THEY HAVE NOT GOT.
THEN SHE TURNED AND WENT.
THERE IS ALREADY A PRETTY LARGER COLLECTION.
I DID NOT GO NEAR THE TREE.
I DO NOT WONDER AT HER FLYING FROM HIM.
FOR YEARS THIS WENT ON.
YOUR MOTHER WILL RIDE HOME WITH ME.
SHE WENT OUT WITH DIRTY CAPS.
YOU MUST DECIDE FOR YOURSELF.
SO THEY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY.
YOU FOLLOW MY MEANING.
HOW ON EARTH DID HE GET THERE.
THIS IS BECAUSE THEY EAT MEN.
I ASK FOR THE LAST TIME.
I WENT UP TO HIM.
I TOOK THE BOOK FROM HER.
WITH THAT FOR A START ALL MAY BE LEARNED.
SHE HAD TO CHOOSE WHAT TO SAY.
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
HE MADE IT HIS HOME.
AND SHE TURNED AND WENT AWAY WITHOUT A WORD.
WE ENTERED THE ROOM.
AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER.
BUT IT DID NOT COME.
AND THEN WHAT DID SHE DO.
THEY DID NOT SEE THEM ANY MORE.
HOW WELL DID I KNOW HER.
IT TURNED US TO SILK.
MY FRIENDS FOUND WATER.
SO PRETTY AND SO YOUNG.
TOGETHER THEY HELD HIM UP.
I GOT UP AND CROSSED THE ROOM TO HIM.
SHE WANTED TO QUESTION HIM.
THEN I TOOK HIS CHILD THERE.
I WOULD NOT MYSELF SAY THAT IT IS SO.
DID I PLEASE YOU.
HE STOOD AWAY FROM HER IN HIS SHAME.
SHE HELD HER HAND TO HIM.
SHE MADE ME BETTER LAST NIGHT.
BUT WE HAVE LOST THE BEST OF MEN.
IT WAS GOOD FOR ME.
WE HAVE CLIMBED ONE STEP UP THE LADDER.
PLUS THE KIDS REALLY LIKE THE DOGS.
EVEN WHEN WE LOSE IT USUALLY A VERY CLOSE GAME.
MOSTLY THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN EUROPE FOLLOWS THE GAME.
WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS SPORTS IN GENERAL.
WAY TO HELP US ALL OUT.
LOVELY TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE SIR.
SUCCESSFUL FIRST DAY FOR COLLEGE.
THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO START.
LOVE IS A STRONG MAN IN THE MIDDLE.
SOMEBODY LET ME KNOW WHEN IT'S OVER.
YOU PUT IT ON WRONG.
COMPETITION IS GOOD FOR THE INDUSTRY.
SHE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE HOUSE AND STARTED.
THEY MAY MAKE ME MORE UNHAPPY THAN I AM.
SHE WOULD BE SORRY FOR HIS DEATH.
MY PEOPLE WILL BRING YOU TO THE SHIP.
IT WAS A PROOF OF HIS FRIENDSHIP.
I FOUND I HAD NO NEED TO THINK.
I SHALL END BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH HER.
IT LOOKED LIKE ONE OF ALARM TO ME.
YOU SAY YOU ARE A BUSINESS MAN.
WE WISH ALL MAY TAKE WORRYING BY BUS.
IF SO HAD YOU NOT BETTER SHOW IT.
NOT ANYONE BUT YOU.
HE CAN STILL BE SAVED.
IS THERE ANYTHING MORE BEFORE I GO OUT.
HE PUT IT BACK IN HIS POCKET.
I COULD NEVER APPEAR BRIGHT BEFORE THE WORLD AGAIN.
TO BEEN THING I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND.
AT NIGHT I DREAM MY HANDS.
WHEN IS THERE LETTER TO GO I WONDER.
HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME RUSHING ABOUT IN IT.
BUT THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE.
THE WATER WAS WRONG AND WE HAD GREAT FUN.
SHE WAS BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD.
NOTHING WILL PUT AN END OF TO HIM.
I THINK I CAN GUESSED AT THE PERSON.
I HUNT ALL OVER THE TOWN TO FIND IT.
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY ALTOGETHER.
IT WAS VERY VERY STRANGE.
NATIONALLY THOUGH THE TREND IS BEGINNING TO TURN UPWARD AGAIN.
WORRY IS PART OF LIFE.
NO NEED FOR A DOCK.
TIME FOR A BIT OF HONOR.
CHECK OUT FOR THE WIN.
IT'S GOING TO BE A BUSY WEEK.
I HAVE NO ONE BUT MYSELF TO BLAMES FOR THIS.
WHAT A PERFECT ENDING TO THE DAY.
LOVING LIFE AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN MINE.
COOL FOR HIM TO STICK UP FOR HER.
DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF THINGS.
THAT WAS HEAD TO SAY.
WANT TO GO FOR A WALK.
CHEERS TO A GREAT GROUP.
FIRST PLACE IN THE DIVISION.
MOVE THE STAR WITH MORE MOVES.
IT'S BEING USED TO MAKE MORE MONEY.
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET THERE.
YOURS IS A PRETTY BUSINESS.
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF IT.
BUT SURELY THERE IS DANGER.
THEN COMES A BLANK IN THE PAPER.
IT SEEMED ALL THAT HE COULD DO TO SPEAK.
RUNNING BY ME BEATING MY ME.
HOW SHALL I DESCRIBE WHAT WE SAW.
AT LEAST I SHALL BE WITH MY OWN PEOPLE.
DRESS THEM IN BLACK AND PLACE THEM OUTSIDE MY TENT.
IF PEOPLE LAUGHED AT HER SHE LAUGHED WITH THEM.
YES I AM A ROMANTIC.
AT LEAST HE COULD KNOW.
SHE HAD STORED THEM IN HER OWN ROOM.
IS NOT EVERY MAN ABLE TO SAY WHAT HE LIKES.
THE DREAM WAS QUITE AT AN END.
SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT.
IT WAS A FINE NIGHT AND PRESENTLY THE MOON APPEARED.
GET YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT TO ASK HER DOWN.
HOW IS HE GETTING ALONG THIS MORNING.
THE LAND WAS STILL LONELY.
COME DOWN TO ME AS SOON AS YOU CAN.
ALL IN GOOD TIME MY DEAR.
SHE SEEMED TO BE QUIET READY FOR THIS.
WE BUY SOME NICE A CLOTHES FOR OUR SALES.
YOU SAW HER ALSO I BELIEVE.
YET SHE LET IT BE.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS TO KNOW HOW TO PAINT.
THE CHILD WAS STILL CRYING.
NO ONE WILL REMEMBER YOU.
THE THIRD BLOW WAS THE ONE THAT KILLED IT.
THE HALL WAS VERY QUIET.
PUT YOU FOOT DOWN TOO.
THE WHOLE THING WAS FAR TOO REAL FOR DREAMING.
NOT TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT.
FOR I WAS NOT YET SAFE.
HOW LONG AGO THAT SEEMED.
AS OF US WE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALONG.
THEY WILL BE SURE IF ANY.
I HAVE COME TO ASK HIM A FEW QUESTIONS.
NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT NEVER IN MY LIFE.
ALL THE REST YOU WILL SEE LATER FOR YOURSELF.
OFFER HIM THAT FROM ME AND COME.
BUT YOUR FRIENDS ARE PROUD AND RICH.
NO CREATURE EVER WANTED SO MUCH TO LIVE.
BUT THERE WAS TROUBLE ENOUGH AT THE OTHER END.
THIS IS THE STUFF TO PUT LIFE IN YOU.
WHAT ABOUT THAT LETTER YOU WERE SPEAKING OF AT BREAKFAST.
AND THEIR HANDS MIGHT JOIN.
USE ME LIKE A STAFF.
I BY NO MEANS WISH TO DIE.
YOU CAN SEE THE REST.
BUT WHAT ELSE HAD HE A RIGHT TO EXPECT.
I HAVE MY OWN PLAN.
I ASKED WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE WAS.
I AM NO LONGER A PARTNER IN THE HOUSE.
IT WAS MY SECRET AND HERS.
BUT IN THIS WORLD WE MUST CONSIDER OTHERS.
NOT ALL THAT MUCH ANYWAY.
HAVE YOU HAD SIGHT OF ANYTHING.
THEY REMAINED THREE HOURS AT TABLE TELLING ABOUT THEIR SPORT.
HE COULD NOT SEE HIMSELF.
ONE TWICE AND THE THIRD TIME DEATH.
I MUST START AT ONCE.
I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM BACK AGAIN IF I COULD.
AN IMPORTANT PRODUCT SUCH AS THIS.
MIGHT I ASK YOUR NAME.
HOWEVER THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT.
WOULD IT NOT BE POSSIBLE TO FIND SUCH.
HERE WE ARE THEN ALL SEATED ROUND THE TABLE.
IN CHURCH AND WAITING ON TRAINS LIKE.
THIS WAS THE PLAN THAT SUGGESTED ITSELF.
THEY ARE OUT OF THE REACH OF ACCIDENT.
THEY LIVED ON PUBLIC DEATH.
HE MIGHT MARRY A GIRL WITH MONEY.
AT LAST HOWEVER THE PARTY WAS MADE UP.
I AM AFRAID HE WILL LEAVE US WITHOUT PITY.
THIS SHALL BE THE PRICE OF HIS LIFE.
THE COUNTRY IS PLEASANT FOR EXERCISE.
I HAD AN APPOINTMENT HERE AT HALF PAST NIGHT.
I THINK WE SHOULD BUILD GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.
I WANT TO BE ON THE SPOT TO HELP.
HE MUST CONSIDER WHAT TO DO NEXT.
SHALL I FEET HIM DOWN.
MY FATHER THINKS TO PAINT THEM.
NOTHING COULD TRUE HIM FROM HIS PURPOSE.
DO NOT BE ANXIOUS ALL IS WHERE.
HOWEVER HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER QUICKLY.
HOW PLEASANT HER MANNER IS.
THE HANDS POINTED FOR FOUR OH CLOTH.
DO NOT EXPECT SO MUCH FOR MY KINDNESS.
HOWEVER I KNOW WHAT HIS ADVICE JUST NOW WOULD BE.
THESE WORDS CHEERED ME UP.
WE SHELL HAVE A SOME TROUBLE.
THERE WILL PROBABLY BE NONE.
HE AND HIS BROTHER SEEMED TO CHANGE PLACES.
HE WAS NOT A PROPER PARTNER FOR HER.
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE A REACHED YOUR AIRS.
I MIGHT AS WELL GO.
WHEN I SEE IT REACH YOUR HAND I FINE.
OH HOW PAINFUL ALL THIS IS.
BUT IT IS STILL ONLY THE FIRST QUARTER.
AND FOR ALL YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE RIGHT.
WE ARE GOING TO KILL THEM BUT NOT THAT WAY.
I HAVE LOOKED WITH MY VERY EYES ON HELL.
IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE LOST OR SOMETHING.
HE MADE NO MOVE IT WOULD COME WHAT WOULD COME.
HE WAS THERE WHEN HIS BEST FRIEND ASKED HER OUT.
WHAT WAS HE EVEN ABOUT TO SAY.
I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER SMILE AGAIN.
YOU AND I WANT THE SAME THING.
THIS WAS THE MAN WHO HAD KILLED HIS FATHER.
THEN I SAW HIM AT ONCE.
I MUST HAVE WALKED INTO IT.
HE PUT HIS OTHER HAND ON THE WALL AS WELL.
BUT I WAS YOUNG THEN AND A LITTLE TOO CURIOUS.
SHE'S LEFT ME HERE TO FACE HIM ON MY OWN.
SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND LOOKED AROUND THE BATHROOM.
I DO THOUGH AND I AM TRYING TO MAKE DO.
IT WAS NOT LIKE SHE HAD ANY POWER OVER ANYTHING.
SHE SHOULD BE THERE IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
HE JUMPED UP BUT ALL WAS STILL ABOUT HIM.
SHE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HER OTHER FRIENDS.
IT IS ONLY FOR YOU.
THEY WOULD NEVER ACCEPT ME AS A GIRL.
I COULD SEE THAT HIS HANDS WERE SHAKING TOO.
SOON YOU WILL HAVE TO GO OUT ON YOUR OWN.
THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT.
THIS WAS NOT MY DAY.
YOU JUST KNOW THAT IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD RIGHT.
I WONDER WHAT WAS GOING ON OVER THERE.
SO ARE YOU HERE TO PLAY WITH ME.
IF YOU WANT TO PROVE SOMETHING THEN DO IT.
THAT WAS WHEN HE SAW IT.
THE MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AND LOOKED INTO IT AGAIN.
AND PUT A HAND DOWN TO HELP HIM UP.
THEY WALKED SLOWLY TO THE VERY END OF IT.
WHAT WAS HE DOING AT THIS MOMENT.
I AM RICH AND SO WAS MY FATHER BEFORE ME.
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A BREATH OF LIFE.
THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY IT.
HE HAD COME OUT ON JOBS WITH ME BEFORE.
I JUST LOOK AT HIM.
THE TWO OF YOU WILL NEED IT.
BUT SHE IS MY LIFE.
IN HIS EYES HE ONLY SAW HER.
WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN NOW DO WE.
I LOOKED OVER THEM ALL.
THERE IS NO HOPE FOR ANY OF US HERE.
IT WAS AN AWFUL THING YET WHAT COULD HE DO.
YOU THOUGHT THE DREADFUL PLACE HAD YOU ONCE MORE.
I LET THE TIME GET AWAY FROM ME.
HE OPENED UP THE DOOR.
THEY HAD A LITTLE GIRL.
I TURNED TO GO THE OTHER WAY.
SHE WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.
THIS IS WHEN ALL OF THE GUARDS BUT ONE LEFT.
HE MUST TURN AROUND TO SEE IF IT IS HER.
I SHOULD NEVER DO IT AGAIN.
I ASKED AS HE MADE A LONG PAUSE.
THAT WAS ALL SHE NEEDED TO DO RIGHT.
BUT THERE WAS NO ONE COMING HIS WAY.
HE WOULD DO IT FOR THEM YES FOR THEM.
I COULD TELL THEY WERE PLOTTING SOMETHING BUT WHAT.
IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT HIM.
I AM NOT HAPPY WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.
THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO WALK OUT AGAIN.
I LIKE TO SEE A MAN ENJOY HIMSELF.
WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU.
THE OTHER TURNED BACK TO THE DOOR SHAKING HIS HEAD.
HE WALKED INTO THE ROOM HE HAD JUMPED FROM.
HE THEN ASKED ME IF I WAS AN ENGLISHMAN.
THAT WAS WHEN SHE SAW IT.
SHE HAD HER HAND OVER HER LEFT CHECK.
THIS IS THE END OF THE FIRST CHAPTER.
IT WAS TOO MUCH TO TAKE.
APART FROM THAT I HAVE VERY LITTLE TO SAY.
HE STILL HAD TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT.
SHE STOPPED TO LOOK DOWN ON HIM.
HE TURNED AROUND AND LOOKED AT ME WHAT.
SHE WAS NOTHING BUT A MURDERER AFTER ALL.
IF HE WAS CALLED UP AGAIN HE WOULD GO AGAIN.
THE GIRL THEN LOOKED AT HER HAND.
WHAT WILL THEY DO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME.
WE HAVE THE BEST PEOPLE ON THIS.
IT WAS AS MUCH AS MY LIFE WAS WORTH.
THERE WAS NO WAY TO TELL FOR SURE.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BUT NOT NOW.
I COULD JUST BARELY SEE IT FROM HERE.
I MADE HIM LOOK ME INTO THE EYES.
THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK.
I WAS COMPLETELY IN MY OWN WORLD RIGHT NOW.
THAT MUST NOT BE IT.
I WAS FOUND BY THEM WHEN I WAS A BABY.
BUT EVEN THAT IS PUTTING HER WILL FIRST.
SO I WILL MAKE A BARGAIN WITH YOU.
I HAVE WATCHED YOU LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT.
SHE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT OF ME AS AN ENEMY.
BUT WHERE WAS SHE THAT SHE SEEMED SO ABSENT.
HE WAS AT A BETTER PLACE.
SHE ACCEPTED IT AND PUT IT WITH HER THINGS.
THEY JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WAS ALL RIGHT.
HE COULD SEE IT WISH HE COULD NOT.
BUT THE EYES WERE THE THING.
AND A GIRL AT THAT.
IT IS YOU WHO IS NO MATCH FOR ME.
YOU GET TO DO THIS JOB ON YOUR OWN.
NO ONE HAD TO KNOW.
I SAY AS I TAKE OUT MY PAPERS.
HE LEFT THEM THERE FOR A LONG TIME HANGING THERE.
I BELIEVE WE SHOULD ALL COME WITH YOU.
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT MORE.
I HAD TO TURN MYSELF AROUND AND GO BACK.
I TURNED TO LOOK BEHIND ME AND SAW NOTHING.
IT WAS THE JAPANESE MAN FROM THE OTHER NIGHT.
HE SEEMED MADE TO LIVE WITH NO ONE BUT HIMSELF.
THIS WAS GOING TO BE A GOOD FIGHT.
WHY WOULD SHE WANT HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE.
BUT THAN THERE WAS STILL HER FATHER.
WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO HERE.
BUT I THINK HE MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC.
I WANTED TO SEE THE WORLD.
THAT WAS ALL HE COULD THINK.
HE LOOKED AT HER FOR A LONG TIME.
AND WHAT OF THAT MAN.
SHE HAD LOVED BEFORE BUT NOT LIKE THIS.
BUT SHE WOULD BE BACK.
THERE IS NO PLACE FOR ME IN HIS HEART.
I KEEP MY EYES ON HIM.
IT SOUNDED AS IF HE WERE GOING TO SAY MORE.
THE BEST ONE I HAVE.
I JUST NEED TO GO THERE.
THEN SHE SAW THE WAY OUT.
HE THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING AND THEN HE ASKED.
HE WAS HE ADMITTED NEVER VERY GOOD WITH HIS HANDS.
I HAVE A GUN TO YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW.
AND HERE YOU ARE AND YOU ARE SO PRETTY.
I WALKED INTO THE ROOM MY HAND ON HER SHOULDER.
HE TURNED AROUND TO FACE HER.
THE FIRST THING IS TO GET HIM AWAY.
I LOOK UP AT THE HOUSE.
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE ONE FOR THE SUBURBS.
AND THERE WAS A STRANGE LOOK IN HER EYES.
THE STUDENT THEN TURNED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED AT ME.
BUT THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE.
SHE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS.
IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE HE COULD SEE ANYTHING.
THERE WAS NO WAY THEY SAW HIM.
NO I DO NOT OWN THEM.
THEY WERE UP TO SOMETHING.
YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHAT WAS ON MY MIND.
I ASKED AS SHE CLOSED THE DOOR.
HE WILL COME BACK IN A LITTLE WHILE.
HE WALKED AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF HER BED.
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING ABOUT HER THAT ATTRACTED ME.
I MUST HAVE AN END PUT TO ALL THIS.
IF NOT HOW SHOULD THEY KNOW HE WAS DEAD.
WHAT ELSE WOULD I WANT TO HAVE.
HE LOOKED OVER HIS HAND AND SMILED.
I AM THE ONE WHO MADE YOU.
I WOULD LOVE FOR US TO STAY THERE ONCE AGAIN.
I ASKED WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE.
BUT SHE HAD LEFT THAT LIFE BEHIND NOW TOO.
THERE WAS NO WAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD BE REALITY.
SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND IN ALL GOOD FAITH.
THEY WERE GOING TO SEND HER BACK IN TIME.
THE WOMAN TURNED HER HEAD TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOW.
THIS GIRL SHE WAS EVERYTHING I NEVER WAS.
THERE WAS ONCE AGAIN SILENCE SO I LET IT BE.
I HAVE TO GO SAY HI TO SOME MORE PEOPLE.
HE THEN LOOKED DOWN AT HIS HANDS.
I HAD VERY LITTLE OF MY OWN.
HE ONE THE OTHER HAND WAS DIFFERENT.
I HAVE NO PLACE IN YOUR HEART.
IT WAS AN AFFAIR THAT BUT OF A MOMENT.
I LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND FOUND THE TRUTH.
IT WAS THE LITERATURE OF LOVE NOT OF THE LOVE.
I WAS VERY NERVOUS FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THIS.
I ACTUALLY OPENED MY EYES AND SAW WHERE I WAS.
HE WAS EVER THE SAME TO ME.
SHE MUST BE COMING FOR ME AGAIN.
HE LOOKED UP AND SAW A MAN.
ALL OF YOU WILL BE THERE.
SHE COULD JUST SEE IT.
BUT NO WAY TO FIND WHAT THEY NEED.
THE FIRST ONE WAS HIS EYES.
THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CARRIAGE WITH THEM.
YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE STORY NOW.
I DROPPED MY HAND AND PUT IT ON MY SIDE.
AND TO THINK I COULD GET AWAY FROM WORK.
THEY OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED IN.
IT'S A GOOD THING NO ONE WAS AROUND THE PLACE.
IF YOU ARE GOING TO COME IN THEN COME IN.
I WANT TO FEEL YOU MORE AND MORE.
NOW I COULD NEVER DO ANY OF THAT AGAIN.
I WOULD LIKE TO LIVE A LONG LIFE.
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT THROUGH.
IT SEEMED THAT WAS WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM.
HE WOULD NOT LET THE CONVENTION END LIKE THIS.
BUT EVEN THIS WAS AS NOTHING.
HE STARTED TO ASK IF I WAS ALL RIGHT.
HE WANTED TO DO THIS RIGHT.
BUT THERE WAS NO ONE.
AND YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW.
HOW COULD HE JUST FIND ME LIKE THAT.
THEN SHE OPENED HER EYES AND LOOKED AT HER WATCH.
IT IS WHAT HE WOULD WANT.
THE GIRL SEEMED TO SEE THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME.
THERE WAS NOTHING HERE TO GO ON.
YOU REALLY THINK YOU ARE GOING TO DEFEAT ME.
BUT IT WILL GET BETTER.
THAT WAS THE WAY OUT.
HE HAD INDEED COME ON MORE THAN HE THOUGHT.
BUT WE WERE STILL THE BEST OF FRIENDS.
THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE YOU WILL BE SAFE.
THERE WAS ANOTHER LITTLE THING HE HAD TO SAY.
HE ASKED AS HE PUT HIS ARM AROUND HER.
WHAT ELSE WAS THERE LEFT TO DO.
AND YET HOW INDIFFERENT IT ALL WAS TO ME NOW.
AND THE WORLD IS OVER.
I NEED TO MAKE IT.
SHE WAS NEVER THE SAME.
I ASKED THEM HOW DO I GET THERE.
HE JUST TURNED AND LEFT.
IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD.
AND SHE AGAIN LOOKED DOWN FOR A MOMENT.
THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME WERE NOT GOING TO LET UP.
THAT IS THE WAY WE MUST BE IN THIS BUSINESS.
BUT NO ONE WAS LOOKING AT HIM.
YOU COULD TELL IT ON HIS FACE.
THE END OF HER TIME WITH HER FRIENDS.
THEY COULD ALL SEE IT NOW.
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE WOMAN THAT MADE HIM UNEASY.
I WALKED OUT THE DOOR.
IF SO THE SOONER HE WAS BACK THERE THE BETTER.
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED TO ME I OPENED MY EYES.
I HAD TO LOOK AWAY.
I PUT MY HAND IN FRONT OF HER.
IT WAS THE LAST THING HE COULD GIVE HER.
SHE IS ON HER OWN WORLD.
SHE HAD MORE THAN ONCE TO REMIND HIM OF THIS.
AND I NEED YOU TO HELP ME.
SHE TURNED AROUND AND LOOKED HIM IN THE EYES.
IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO.
THEY WOULD NOT KNOW IT.
THERE WILL BE AN END OF THAT NOW.
BUT OF ONE THING SHE IS SURE.
YOU HAVE A GIRL WITH YOU.
THIS WAS WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR.
THE MAN WALKED TO THE WOMAN.
BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE TO COME.
AND HE WAS STILL THAT LITTLE BOY.
I HAD NO WHERE ELSE TO GO.
I KNOW YOU WANT TO GIVE ME A GOOD LIFE.
HE ASKED ALL OF US.
I JUST HAD A LONG DAY.
NO ONE WAS IN THE ROOM.
HE LOOKED TO HIS SIDE AND SMILED.
HOW MUCH WOULD THEY KNOW OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
SO ENJOY AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF IT.
THEN SHE TURNED TO HIM.
YOU WILL HAND HIM OVER TO ME.
HE WAS A GOOD MAN THOUGH.
I WANT YOU AND YOU ARE COMING BACK WITH US.
I SMILED AND WALKED OUT THE DOOR.
I WANTED TO SEE WHO SHE WAS.
AND HE PUT IT AGAIN.
WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY FOR MYSELF.
THIS WAS NOT RIGHT NOT RIGHT AT ALL.
I AM SURE YOU KNOW IT.
I CAN TAKE THEM OFF IF YOU NEED ME TO.
I SAW AT ONCE HOW IT WAS.
AND THERE IT STOPPED FOR A MOMENT.
NO ONE WOULD GET THE BEST OF HIM.
ALL THAT KIND OF THING WAS NOTHING TO HIM NOW.
THE PERSON LOOKED AT THE BACK.
SHE LOOKED HARD AT THE MAN.
NOW THAT HE HAD THE TIME.
BUT WHAT ELSE AM I TO DO.
HE HAD TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.
THERE IT WAS RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.
HOW WAS I GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE.
HE LOOKED BACK AT HER.
AND YOU LIKE IT THAT WAY.
BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT SHE HAD WANTED.
THEY ARE ONE IN THE SAME.
SHE SMILED AND WALKED WITH HIM.
THERE IS NO NEED TO GO THERE.
SO WHAT THEN WERE WE TO DO.
I THINK I WILL RIGHT NOW.
YOU LOOK OVER AND YOU SEE A BOY.
I SAW YOU TAKE THEM.
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AS I MADE UP MY MIND.
THAT IS THEY WOULD IF I HAD ANY FRIENDS.
THIS TIME IT WAS A WOMAN.
I TURNED AROUND TO FACE IT.
IT WAS THE ONLY ROOM WITH THE DOOR STILL CLOSED.
AND IT JUST MIGHT BE.
I LEFT HER AT HOME.
HE LOOKED AWAY FROM IT.
BUT IT WAS EVEN SO.
BUT AT THE END WHAT DO WE GET.
THERE WAS NO WAY OUT OF THIS ROOM.
THAT HAD TO BE IT THEN.
IT IS A HAND ON MY.
HE WILL WANT ME JUST FOR ME.
THEY TURNED ALL TO HIM.
AND I LIKE HER EYES.
BUT HERE NOW HE REALLY WAS.
THE OTHER ONE WAS BACK IT WAS TIME AGAIN.
YOU ASKED TO SEE IT.
I JUST WANTED TO GO UP THERE.
I CAN ONLY DO IT ONCE.
BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HELP IT.
HE WALKED OVER TO THE DOOR AND OPENED IT.
THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE TO IT THAN THAT.
I LOOKED AROUND BUT I STILL FOUND NO ONE.
I KNOW THAT THEY WILL NOT LET ME DOWN.
THIS WAS THE GOOD SIDE TO IT.
I NEVER SAW HIM LOOKING LIKE THAT.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH HIM.
I WAS BACK IN THE ROOM.
SHE LOOKED UP AT ME AND SMILED.
HE WOULD NEVER DO THIS.
WHAT COULD YOU DO WITH A GIRL.
AND SHE HAD TO BE LIKE HIM.
BUT HE WAS STILL THERE.
YOU JUST HAVE TO MAN.
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY CAN DO.
HE SAW NO NEED OF IT.
THERE WAS BUT ONE THING LEFT TO DO.
THEY ALL TURNED TO ME.
I THINK I WANTED TO SEE HIM AGAIN.
HE LOOKED TO HIS LEFT THEN TO HIS RIGHT.
I HAD TO GO TO MY PLACE.
IT WILL BE THE END OF THEM.
THAT WAS ALL I WAS GOING TO SAY ABOUT IT.
I WAS ON TO SOMETHING.
SHE TURNED AROUND AND WALKED TO THE DOOR.
I MADE IT JUST IN TIME.
HE HAD NOTHING ELSE HE WANTED TO DO OUT HERE.
SHE PRESENTED HIM WITH A ROSE.
AT LAST OUR RANKS WERE BREAKING.
NO SUCH LUCK GRACED HER HOWEVER.
THE MACHINE MUST HAVE HELPED ME STAY AWAKE.
THEY ALL JUMPED UP FROM THEIR SEATS SUDDENLY.
IT'S NO PROBLEM SHE WAVED OFF.
LET US BEGIN ON THOSE DEBTS.
TO RESTORE YOUR LOST ENERGY.
WE SHIFT BACK INTO SILENCE.
HE NODDED SLOWLY AND IMPRESSIVELY.
IT HAD VERY NEARLY COME.
YOU KNOW THEY CAN PROBABLY DO THAT.
A COOL ONE THIS GENERAL.
MAYBE SOON BUT CERTAINLY NOT NOW.
EVEN IF IT TAKES SEVERAL YEARS.
MY BREATH COMES IN IN SHARP PAINFUL BURSTS.
SO EVERYONE WOULD BE SATISFIED.
THIS FLOOR LOOKED REALLY RUN DOWN.
IN FACT WE FOUND THEM EXCEEDINGLY USEFUL.
TAKE OUT OR HOME COOKED.
WHY WAS NATURE SO CRUEL.
AT THE SAME TIME THE SAME FLOWER.
DO YOU THINK ANYONE ELSE IS ALIVE OUT THERE.
HE NEVER SHUT HIS EYES.
I AM NOT A CHILD NOR YET A FOOL.
FINALLY SHE TURNED AND FACED HIM.
LET US INSTALL OURSELVES IN THIS HALL.

NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH YOUR THING.
BUT SHE'S HERE HELPING ME.
DEATH ITSELF HAD COME WITHOUT PAIN.
REMOVAL OR LESSENING OF EITHER.
HIS FATHER CALLED DOWN BELOW.
A SILLY BUSINESS ON ALL SIDES.
SHE STARTED EATING BEFORE GIVING HER OPINION.
FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE.
A QUICK JUMP OVER THE WIDENING GAP SAVED HIM.
HE DRIFTED OUT AND AWAY ALONG SUNSET TRACK.
THE MOON WOULD NOT RISE TILL LATER.
HIS FATHER HAZARDED ONE GUESS.
WHEN HE RETURNED HE ASKED IF THEY WERE HUNGRY.
BEING WITHOUT YOU MAKES ME VERY UNHAPPY.
THOSE EYES COULD STOP BULLETS.
SHE ALWAYS MAKE THEM MAD.
WHAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE THEN.
WAS IT MOVING AS AN AUTOMOBILE.
ONE FURTHER REMARK HOWEVER LEFT HIS LIPS.
WE MUST GET BETTER ACQUAINTED.
YOU ATTACKED US AFTER ALL.
BUT SOMETIMES LIFE CAN HURT.
CHAPTER ONE FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL.

THIS PLACE IS BAD NEWS.
WELL YOUR ABOUT HALF RIGHT.
JUST WISHING EACH OTHER LUCK.
AN ALMOST PAINFUL QUIET REIGNS.
WAS I IN A HOSPITAL OR SOMETHING.
HE LOOKED AROUND THE HOTEL RESTAURANT.
BEST TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANTED.
NOTHING SHOWED THAT ANYTHING HAD OCCURRED.
SHE WHISPERED ANGRY AT HER LOSS OF CONTROL.
YOU CAN SLEEP HERE TONIGHT.
THEY CLEARLY HAVE EVERYTHING THOUGHT THROUGH.
A BROKEN LAND SITTING ON BROKEN GROUND.
ONCE AGAIN HE HOPED IT WOULD LAST.
NO SUCH THING AS TRUST.
HER THIN WHITE FINGERS WERE GRIPPING ITS SIDES.
IMAGINE TEN TIMES MORE DIRT.
IN THIS MOMENT SHE IS HAPPY.
WE KNOW WHERE YOU RUN.
THINGS ARE MOVING ALONG SO FAST.

PRESENTLY HOWEVER IT WAS BROKEN.
I WAS JUST THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE.
JUST SET HOOK AND PUT THE PRESSURE.
SO MUCH FOR A UNITED FRONT.
BUT THE STREETS WERE RELATIVELY CALM SATURDAY MORNING.

YOU HAD TO STAY WITH LEADERS.

IT'S A HUMAN BEING THING.
THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG WAY TO MAKE ART.
IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HOME FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK.
PEOPLE CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT WITH THEIR SPOONS.
GET OUT OF MY BED.
THERE IS NO END TO PREVENTION.
IT WILL HAVE A BODY AGAIN.
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY ALTOGETHER.
IT WAS VERY VERY STRANGE.
NATIONALLY THOUGH THE TREND IS BEGINNING TO TURN UPWARD AGAIN.
WORRY IS PART OF LIFE.
NO NEED FOR A DOCK.
TIME FOR A BIT OF HONOR.
CHECK OUT FOR THE WIN.
IT'S GOING TO BE A BUSY WEEK.
I HAVE NO ONE BUT MYSELF TO BLAMES FOR THIS.
WHAT A PERFECT ENDING TO THE DAY.
LOVING LIFE AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN MINE.
COOL FOR HIM TO STICK UP FOR HER.
DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF THINGS.
THAT WAS HEAD TO SAY.
WANT TO GO FOR A WALK.
CHEERS TO A GREAT GROUP.
FIRST PLACE IN THE DIVISION.
MOVE THE STAR WITH MORE MOVES.
IT'S BEING USED TO MAKE MORE MONEY.
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET THERE.
HE WAS THOUGHT OF THAT HIGHLY.
HOWEVER HE IS NOT LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE.
SO WE PUT HIM IN THE AD.
HE LOVED THE GAME AND HE LOVED TALKING ABOUT IT.
YOUR THE REASON I MAKE IT THROUGH THE DAY.
WATCH HERE TO SEE IF YOU ARE A WINNER.
AUSTRALIA WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU.
HOW OLD IS THE INNER YOU.
NOT FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR THE OTHERS.
BUT FOR A GOOD CAUSE.
I HAD A GREAT TIME THIS WEEK.
WHEN YOU NEED TO CRY YOU CRY.
CAN YOU SEE WHAT IS WHAT IT WAS FOR.
COFFEE IS FOR THE WEAK.
LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING BACK TO WORK.
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND SOME MONEY ON YOUR SITE.
WE CAN SEE IT NOW.
EVERYBODY NOWADAYS MUST SUFFER BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW THEMSELVES.
I LOOKED BUT COULD SEE NOTHING.
SHE WAS ALMOST LIKE A BOY.
WHO KNOWS WHAT TO EXPECT.
PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING AND SHOUTING.
SOME WONDER IF THEY EVER WILL.
WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO TRAIN.
UNLUCKY LOOKS LIKE WE WERE THE BETTER TEAM.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE SITE.
BELIEF IS THE DEATH OF REASON.
HER IS NOT IN THE MILITARY.
ALL I CAN DO FOR YOU NOW.
BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE MOVE.
I SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET THERE.
SO IT'S GOOD THING FOR HIM.
THIS WILL BE A WILD RIDE TO THE FINISH.
HE'S REASON FOR THE SEASON.
LAY OFF GIVE IT A REST.
THIS LIFE IS THE BEST LIFE.
WHAT THEY WE WERE DOING THERE.
YOU WERE SOME SORT OF OFFICIAL.
I WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO.
A SURGEON WAS AT WORK AMONG THE SUFFERERS.
THIS PAST WEEK HE PICKED IT UP AGAIN.
HE'S JUST BEING HIMSELF AND THAT'S ALL WE NEED.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD FIT RIGHT IN.
WHICH GIVE IS YOU AN IDEA.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THEM CAME ON.
THE CRIME RATE IS HIGH.
CHECK IT OUT YOU WILL NOT TO AN DISAPPOINTED.
GIRL YOU ALL YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.
WHAT IS GOING ON IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.
BUT THEY IT'S THE SING PRINCIPLE.
WHAT'S A COUPLE OF YEARS.
I NEED TO GO TO THE BAN.
THEN A FRIEND OF THE WORLD.
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS PICTURE.
I NEED TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON MY SON.
SEE YOU IN THE SKIN.
WE REALLY NEED TO TRY AND GET TOGETHER.
THOSE ARE NOT PART OF THE RULES.
NOW THERE'S A SPECIAL MAGICAL.
WELL THEN I DO KNOW.
HOWEVER MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE LEFT US WITH NO OTHER CHOICE.
NEARLY ALL REPUBLICANS VOTED AGAINST THE MEASURE.
I CAN UNDERSTAND HIS DESIRE TO GET ANOTHER OPINION.
A YEAR LATER THE PLANT WAS CLOSED.
DEFINE YOUR OWN ROLE IN A SITUATION.
BUT HE IS EXPECTED TO BE FULL STRENGTH HIS WEEK.
MONEY IS THE REASON FOR SUCCESS.
I LEARNED A LOT DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS.
MISSING YOU USED TO BE EASY.
I MAY NOT BE ALL THAT TO YOU.
SO IT'S THAT KIND OF PARTY.
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE BACK.
EVERYTHING IS IN GOD'S WORD.
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD CHALLENGE.
YOU NEED TO MAKE A TRIP HERE.
I SEE THAT NOW IT IS TOO NIGHT.
HOLDING THE CUTS CLOSE CLOSED.
I PUT THE GUN DOWN.
I SHALL BE AT HAND FOR THE TRIAL.
SOME THERE ARE WHO CAN SEE AND GO FORTH.
AND STATES HAVE NOT HAD MUCH TIME.
WE FEEL THE PUBLIC IS BEING USED.
WE SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE CONFIDENCE.
I WAS TURNED AROUND TO GET THE PLANE THAT FIRED.
GUNS WERE USED FOR ABOUT THREE OF EVERY FIVE KILLINGS.
THAT'S THE WAY I WANT TO BE.
IT WAS NOTHING SHORT OF MAGIC.
CAN WE JUST GET BACK TO THE ADS PLEASE.
LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.
I WANT TO GO BAD.
SO BEAUTIFUL I WANT TO SEE INSIDE.
IN THE POLICE STATE NONE OF US ARE SAFE.
WELCOME THIS YOUR HOME.
EVEN THEN HE WANT TO WIN.
SMILE TO COVER UP THE PAIN.
EVERYTHING IS STARTING TO FALL INTO PLACE PERFECTLY.
SORRY NOT A FAN OF THAT DECISION.
THERE WAS A GENTLE KNOCK ON THE DOOR.
BUT THE EYES WERE STRIKING.
YOU HAVE ONLY TO GO ON.
HUMAN ERROR CAN ALSO BE A FACTOR.
BUT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY PHYSICAL GAME.
HE COULD SING ANY PART IN A SONG.
IT MAKES YOU WANT TO EAT THE CAKE.
NOW IT FEELS LIKE HOME.
AND ALL YOU CAN DO IS ENOUGH.
HE WILL RANK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST.
IT'S A BOTTLE OF WATER.
ASH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO RETURN TO WORK AFTER LUNCH.
GREAT THAT YOU ARE SO NICE TO YOUR FANS.
ALL BACK TO NORMAL TOMORROW.
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP ONE PEOPLE.
GET ME OUT OF THIS PLACE NOW.
SO GLAD TO HAVE A GOOD MAN NOW.
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.
NO HE'S GOING ON STRAIGHT.
HE MOTIONED THE TO THE YARD.
THIS IS NOT THE TREASURE.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MARRIED.
THE RESULT WAS AN UPSET.
THE PAPER PUBLISHED NO DETAILS AND THERE WAS NO ATTACK.
PREVIOUSLY THIS WAS NOT THE CASE.
SHOW WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.
LIKE IS A STRONG WORD.
I WILL HAVE TO HAVE A LOOK.
REALITY IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF STRESS.
IT'S HARD TO LET GO OF TRADITIONS.
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE OF THIS TASK.
YOUR CARE FOR THE POOR.
DO THEY REALLY HAVE TO SAY THAT.
DO YOU KNOW WHO AND WHAT YOU ARE SUPPORTING.
AND KEEP IN TOUCH WITH HER.
GOOD MAN WILL BE MISSED.
WERE IS IT GOING TO BE HOT.
GREAT TO SEE YOU TWO.
JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD UP BROTHER.
HERE IS MY PHONE NUMBER IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING.

SO KIND GOD BLESS YOU.
HOPING FOR A GREAT CAMPAIGN.
FINAL DAY OF THE MASTERS.

NOTHING TO GIVE UP FOR IT.
HOW WOULD YOU GET OUT OF THIS.
I MIGHT BE AWAY FOR A WEEK OR MORE.
SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON THE FIELD FINALLY.
LIGHT ARE THEY GOING TO GENTLE ME.

I'M LOOKING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU.
WELL THEN A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CLEARLY WRONG.
GOING TO BE A FUN TRIP.
BUT WHAT HAPPENED AT THE PARTY WHO KNOWS.
LIFE'S A BEACH AS IT WERE.
I LOSE MYSELF IN DARKNESS.
THE NEED FOR A FIX.
THAT'S HOW YOU CAN TELL IT'S THERE.
THAT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM.
WE WANT OUR TEAMS TO REMAIN WHERE THEY ARE.
AM I EVEN CLOSE TO WHERE I WANT TO BE.
THIS IS JUST THE WAY I FEEL MOST COMFORTABLE WORKING.
I KNOW THAT WILL HAPPEN.
AND WE BOTH HAVE PLAYERS WHO CAN RUN AND JUMP.
REMEMBER THE CHARITY STREAM IS TOMORROW.
I WOULD LOVE TO FORGET.
ACTUALLY IS GOING TO BE BETTER OFF.
LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF IT LATER.
THREW A PARTY OF COURSE.
WE WILL BE THERE WAITING FOR THEM.
ALWAYS PUT EVERYTHING ON THE LINE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO READ ABOUT.
LESS GOVERNMENT NOT MORE IS THE SOLUTION.
ONLY WAY TO HAVE A FRIEND IS TO BE ONE.
THAT THING HAD A LOT OF TIRES.
THE FATHER OF HER CHILD WAS NOT EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD.
WHAT IF BUSINESS MAN SHOULD ACT IN THIS MANNER.
KILLING'S NOT PART OF IT.
HE WOULD NOT SAY IF THERE WERE SUSPECTS.
THAT'S WHAT WE THINK THEY WERE LOOKING FOR.
I THINK EVERYONE ACROSS THE BOARD IS SAD.
WE NEED TO DO BETTER.
HOW DO YOU GET A REPORTER IN TO COVER THAT.
POLICE RESPONDED WITH TEAR GAS.
GOING TO COME BACK AND TRY TO CLEAN UP SOMETHING.
DREAM IT SEE IT AND BE IT.

JUST GIVE THEM A CHANCE.
IT'S MARCH WHY IS IT SNOWING.
GET HIM IN THE TEST TEAM.
FOLLOW THE LINK BELOW TO REGISTER.
SO THERE IS GOING TO BE A SNOW STORM TONIGHT.
SHE WAS ABOUT TO GET LUCKY SHE COULD JUST TELL.
THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A MISTAKE AS THAT.
I LOST MY JACKET IN THE SECOND GAME.
BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WAS.
WHO ELSE WOULD YOU WANT OUT THERE.
THIS IS GOOD FOR US.
THERE ARE THINGS IN LIFE THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
EVEN YOU CAN SEE THAT.
RUNNING ON THE STREETS NOT SO MUCH.
HAPPINESS IS NOT A GOAL BUT A WAY OF LIFE.
HAPPY TO BE YOUR HELP.
WHAT IS THE WORST ONE.
ACTUALLY WE ARE STILL HAVING.
LIVE IN HALF AN HOUR FOR OUR STREAM.
CREATED THE WORLD YOU WANT TO LIVE IN.
SURELY YOU HAVE THE ANSWER RIGHT.
IN ABOUT THE THIRD ROW.
REMEMBER THE TIME YOU WERE HUNGRY.
HER MOTHER HER MOUTH WAS VERY CLOSE TO HIS MOUTH.
SHE COULD GO IN OR SHE COULD GO AWAY.
THESE PEOPLES ARE MY PEOPLES TOO YOU KNOW.
AND YOU CANNOT EVEN JOIN.
IT WAS NOT A CONSCIOUS DECISION.
SO IT WAS VERY HELPFUL.
I WANTED HIM TO DO IT HERE.
TIME TO GET THE SECOND ONE.
NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO THERE YOU ARE.
I MADE UP MY MIND A LONG TIME AGO.
MAKE THE MOST OUT OF THE PRESENT.
LET GOD TAKE CARE OF THE REST.
ACTUALLY I HAVE TO RUN.
MY SAINTS HAVE TO BE BETTER.
IF YOU ARE BLAMING YOU ARE NOT BEING GRATEFUL.
LOTS OF BLUE AND WHITE TODAY.
ABOUT TO BE A LONG DAY.
ALL OF US HAVE RIGHT.
TIME FOR ME TO MAKE SOME DECISION.
SHE FOLLOWED HIM WITH HER EYES.
I WANT YOUR GOOD NOTHING SO MUCH AS THAT.
SHE TOUCHED HIM ON THE CHECK WITH HER LIPS.
BUT THEY HAD NO CHANCE TO FLY YET.
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING GOOD WITH IT.
THAT'S THE MINIMUM THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO ME PERSONALLY.
SPEAKER AFTER SPEAKER CALLED FOR AN END TO MILITARY RULE.
I GET ALL MY MONEY FROM ABROAD.
I DO WHAT I THINK IS FUNNY.
BEFORE THEY GET DOWN TO ZERO.
TODAY IS GOING TO BE A BUSY DAY.
EDITOR AT FAN OF ROCK.
THEY HAD A BIG TIME.
OLD PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DRIVE.
THE MOST POWERFUL THING YOU CAN DO IS RECOVER.
TODAY WAS THE START OF A REVOLUTION.
ANGER IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO CONTROL.
CHILL DOWN WITH THE TALENT.
NOTE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THIS THING.
ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE A BRITISH PREMIERE.
I THOUGHT IT'S WAS A FUN FACT.
UNABLE TO CATCH THE JETS GAME.
AT LEAST IT WILL BE THIS TERM.
BUT I KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
BUT SUCH ARE THE MILITARY.
THERE'S TOO MUCH A STAKE TO DO OTHERWISE.
IT'S HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE.
PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW I CAN BE OF SERVICE.
PARADISE MAY BE AROUND THE CORNER.
CALL ME IF YOU DO.
ROLL UP TO THE PARTY LIKE.
USED TO BE AN OLD SCHOOL I THINK.
I NEED TO KEEP UP WITH THINGS BETTER.
SHE WAS THERE FOR A CONCERT.
TAKE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.
AT THE COST OF WHAT.
THAT'S A BUCKET LIST GOAL.
SO GIVE ME SOMETHING TO BELIEVE.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR ALL YOU DO.
IT WAS TIGHT FIT.
AND THEN BY HIS GRAVE HIS EYES OPENED.
THEN YOU MUST MAKE SOUP OUT OF THE SNAKES.
THAT'S THE BEST GAME ALWAYS.
I WAS NOT LEFT DRIFTING.
HAD IT HAPPENED ON PURPOSE.
I APOLOGIZE TO THE COURT.
NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE IS THE PLAN WILL WORK.
I THINK HE CAN LEAD US TO VICTORY AGAINST ANYBODY.
HE IS ALSO AMONG THOSE TRYING TO LEARN HOW.
HE WOULD REACH BACK AND GET A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY STATUE.
SOCIAL AND DOWN TO EARTH.
FINISHED RISE OF THE LAST NIGHT.
WONDER WHAT HE THINKS WE SHOULD DO WITH HIM.
OR IT IS JUST ME AND WHO CARES.
I KIND OF LIKE THIS SNOWSTORM.
SO MUCH TO DO TOMORROW.
WHY DO YOU WANT TO REPLACE HIM.
IT'S PART OF THE SERIES.
COLLEGE IS ALL ABOUT SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR THE FUTURE.
LET HER HAVE HER OWN WAY FOR THE MOMENT.
AND FOR THIS HE IS PUT TO SHAME.
AND AS SUCH YOU NEED HELP.
THE MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME IS NOT FAR TO SEEK.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR EYES.
BUT THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE OFFICIAL COMMENT.
I LOVED HER WITH ALL MY HEART.
WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT.
THURSDAY IS THE LAST DAY OF THIS YEAR'S DEBATE.
BUT IT MIGHT BE ALL ABOUT THE PHYSICAL PLAY.
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO AN INTERVIEW.
IT IS A FORM OF SELFISHNESS.
JUST TO HEAR HIS VOICE.
HOPING THAT THEY ARE DOING THE SAME WITH THIS ONE.
WHAT ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE UNIVERSE.
SO IN NEED OF A GOOD MOVIE.
SOMETIMES THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS NOTHING.
HE WAS TRYING TO KEEP YOU SAFE.
LEARN THE WHY NOT JUST THE WHAT.
IT'S NICE TO HAVE A BREAK.
THEN IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING NEW.
HAD A NICE DAY AT THE ZOO.
LEARN TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE PRESSURE.
I BELIEVE IN YOU YOU CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.
ARE YOU COMING TO BED.
IT WAS TOUGH FOR US AT THE TIME.
IT'S VERY MUCH PART OF MY INTIMATE LIFE.
IT'S TOO PRECIOUS TO US TO LET IT DIE.
IT'S ALL PART AND PARCEL OF NEW MANAGEMENT STYLE.
TROOPS MOVE IN TO BREAK UP SOME STRIKES.
WHERE IN SOUTH AFRICA ARE YOU FROM.
GOD I LOVE THIS MAN ALREADY.
SO GRATEFUL TO BE A PART OF THIS.
GOOD PEOPLE COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT.
JUST CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF MYSELF IN THE MIRROR.
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE YOU MUST BE THE DIFFERENCE.
BE THE MIRACLE YOU WANT TO SEE IN THE WORLD.
SOMEONE WANT TO GO TO WORK FOR ME.
OR DO YOU WANT ME TO.
ONE LOOK WILL BE SUFFICIENT.
NO ANGEL WOULD DO SUCH A THING.
HUMANE DOCTORS MOST OF THEM.
THE PROFESSOR TURNED DOWN THE SHEETS.
THIS WAS THE GIRL HE HAD HAD DOUBTS OF.
IT WAS A SMALL ROOM.
THEY TALK ABOUT THE MOUNTAINS.
EVERYTHING IS STILL AHEAD OF ME.
HE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWER.
THEY GET USED TO THE HEAT.
LET'S MAKE SURE THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.
WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU MAKE IT UP HERE.
BECAUSE IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
BUT STILL NO IDEA WANT WHAT TO ASK.
SO PLEASE FEEL FREE TO LET US KNOW.
WHERE DO YOU THINK IS A GOOD FIT.
I REALLY NEED TO DO BETTER.
HE HAD TO GET OUT OF THE CARE CAR.
INSTEAD YOU GIVE ME SUN.
I DO NOT WANT TO PLAY THIS.
DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THE THINGS YOU SAY.
THANK YOU FOR THE POST.
WELL ALL TIME TO CALL IT A NIGHT.
THIS PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE BEST MOVIE EVER.
AND IT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME.
I WAS TRYING TO GUESS THE TIME.
THERE WERE HATS BUTTONS AND RED WHITE AND BLUE BALLOONS.
SHE WILL FIGHT AND WE ARE READY.
I WANTED THIS TO END.
IT IS AN INNER INTERNATIONAL WORD.
HE WAS REPORTED IN GUARDED CONDITION TODAY.
ADVICE AS FAR AS WHAT.
WORK IS NOT ALL THAT TO LIFE.
YES AND THE DEADLY ONE TOO.
MEANWHILE IS IT PIG ROAST YET.
PUTTING ALL OF US AT RISK OF A NUCLEAR WAR.
BUT THERE WAS NO PROTEST.
EVERYBODY IS GETTING READY FOR THEIR PITCH.
SHOW THE PAY RICE VIDEO.
WELL THAT WAS JUST RIDICULOUS.
OR THE ONE WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHERS.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY IT'S POPULAR.
YES IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE.
HOPE YOU ALL HAD A GOOD WEEKEND.
HE HAD A MOMENT OF DOUBT.
THEY ENTERED THROUGH THE OPENING ON THE BEACH.
I THINK WE NEED THAT TYPE OF PERSON.
ASK THEM IF THEY PLAN TO VOTE.
IT'S A GAME OF CHEESE BABY.
IT IS MUCH MORE THAN THIS.
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS EXECUTE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH TO YOU AND THE TEAM.
HAVE YOU SET A DATE FOR YOUR VIDEO YET.
I HAD SO MUCH FUN WITH YOU YESTERDAY.
READY UP ON THE BENEFITS.
ALL I WANT TO BE HAPPY.
I HOPE YOU FIND OUT WHAT THE WORD IS.
NEED TO FIND A WAY TO FIX THAT.
TRULY IT WILL BE A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.
THAT IS NOT A SALARY.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HAIR.
LOVE MAKES ME FEEL ALIVE.
IT WOULD BE A GREAT FOR US TO ADD HIM.
SO YOU KNOW IS GOING TO BE FUN.
I WALK INTO THE ROOM TRYING TO SMILE.
SPRING AND THE BIRDS ARE COURTING.
SENDING YOU LOVE AND BLESSINGS.
I THINK HE'S IN A REAL BIND.
ONE WAS KILLED AND THE OTHER WAS WOUNDED.
THOSE ARE FAITH FAMILY AND FREEDOM.
HE'S BETTER THAN A TANK.
HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD MEAL.
SO DO YOU NOT HAVE IT.
AND WE NEED TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR IT.
THIS IS AN OLD PATTERN.
I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SEE THIS.
MY HEART IS FULL OF LOVE.
THEY MADE IT EASY TO FIND EVERYTHING.
I AM READY TO MOVE UP AND ON.
WE SHOULD BE MORE SELFISH.
I THINK YOU CAN TAKE IT YOURSELF.
WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR TODAY.
WANT TO GET RID OF THOSE DARK SPOTS.
I WANTED HER TO BE MY DAUGHTER.
MAY PASSED IN A BLAZE OF SUNSHINE.
WHAT COULD HAVE MADE HIM.
WHY WOULD I WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
HE MAY COME BACK TOMORROW WITH ANOTHER OFFER WHO KNOWS.
IT COULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING THERE.
SO FAR NO ONE IS EXPECTED TO LOSE THEIR JOB.
THE STORM HIT ABOUT AN HOUR LATER.
BOTH PLAYERS HOWEVER WERE AFFECTIES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.
I AM GOING TO LEARN.
STUFF FOR THE OTHER ACCOUNT.
THIS IS THE ONLY ONE I FOUND.
GREAT BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION.
I WAS JUST GOING TO WRITE THAT.
WELCOME TO THE NEW WORLD.
BE SURE TO CHECK THIS OUT TONIGHT.
PERHAPS YOU CAN HELP ME.
HELLO RICH I AM SORRY TO HEAR THIS.
HAD A GREAT FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.
THIS IS AN OLD ARREST.
WHY DO YOU NEED ME NOW.
WELL THAT IS A VERY FAIR POINT.
I SHOUTED AS I JUMPED OUT OF THE TRUCK.
THAT'S THE KIND OF PERSON I LIKE TO DEAL WITH.
I BELIEVE I'M THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB.
THE GENERAL CONCLUSION WAS THAT IT IS NOT THAT SIMPLE.
IT WAS A GREAT PLAY.
OIL PRICES ALSO ROSE SHARPLY.
BUT DO YOU HAVE IT IN BLACK.
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR IT.
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS LET ME KNOW.
DOING IT RIGHT DURING THE LAST WEEK OF WORK.
GREAT PICTURE OF THE FIELD.
THE ONLY IN THE LEAGUE.
I WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS THREAD.
WILL HAVE TO FACE THE MUSIC TOMORROW.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST THOUGH.
IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST ONES TO ME.
NEW ONE FOR THE GIRLS.
HE HAD NEVER HAD AN ATTENDANT FOR HIS OWN PERSON.
YES BY THE MEMORY OF MY FATHERS.
I WAS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE MASTER TO ANOTHER.
BUT HE WAS CAREFUL NOT TO SHOW IT.
IT'S DO OR DIE FOR THEM.
THE IDEAS OF COURSE ARE NOT NOT NEW.
POLICE HAVE YET TO CHARGE ANYONE IN BOMBINGS.
THIS IS NOT AN ARGUMENT FOR BUSINESS AS USUAL.
HE CALLED FOR EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TARGETING THE ISSUE OF WEAPONS.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S COOL.
WHO IS MOST BEAUTIFUL IN THEM.
AND BY THEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE.
YOU CAN DO IT BUD.
I AM GLAD YOU ARE BACK.
NOW YOU CAN BE TOO.
I REALLY LIKE THE LOOK OF IT THOUGHTS.
FINAL NIGHT NIGHTS OF THE CONFERENCE.
IT'S SUCH A GREAT SERIES.
MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH FRIENDS TODAY.
BECAUSE WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE DEAD.
HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT BETTER.
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THIS IS IT.
THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF THEM.
BEST TO PLAY SAFE ANYWAY.
IS THERE A GOOD PLACE AT TABLE.
AND I LOVE YOU SO.
YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.
WHAT WAS THE TIME NOW.
THERE ARE BOTH MY HANDS.
HE WAS RIGHT IN THIS.
BUT HE WILL HAVE NO USE FOR IT.
WHAT A SHOULDER AND NECK SHE HAD.
HOW HE LOVES ME.
HOW CAN I TELL IT YOU.
HE WILL HAVE SIX WEEKS OF ME.
AND AFTER THAT IT WILL BE MY TURN.
HER WATCH WAS OUT.
NO SNOW WAS FALLING.
WHAT HAVE YOU MISSED.
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME SOMETHING FIRST.

I LOVE YOU IN EVERY DRESS.
AS FOR ME I AM WAITING.
I CAN ONLY WATCH.
HAD SHE NO MOTHER.
I WAS NOT LISTENING.
THEY ARE FORTY IN IT.
THE YEAR WAS NOW OVER.
IT WAS A SMALL ONE.
SHE CARES FOR NO ONE.
IN SHORT IT WAS HIS DAY.
AND TURN ALL THOSE PEOPLE OUT.
I AM TO TAKE THE CHAIR.
I TURNED THE CHILD ROUND.
YOU DO NOT KNOW MINE.
BUT THAT WILL IN CLOUDS.
SHE WAS SO LIKE YOU CHILD.

WHO IS TO SAY HOW TO IT WAS BROWN.
LOVE YOUR PARENTS YOUNG ONES.
AND SHE LOOKS AFTER THEY.
WHAT PEOPLE WHERE IN THE HOUSE.
WHY SURELY OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
YOU KNOW THE SAME OF ME.
IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HER.
THEN MISS BROWN TURNED ROUND IN HER CHAIR.
TELL ME IS SHE WELL AND HAPPY.
YOU WILL CARE FOR ME.
NO ONE KNOWS WHO DOES IT.
THEY MUST HAVE DONE IT FOR FUN.
HE WAS AFRAID TO KNOW HIS WAS ALONE.
SO WERE THE OTHERS.
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE MATTER MORE SOME OTHER TIME.
I'M GLAD TO MEET YOU.
I KNOW NOTHING OF THESE STORIES.
HE COULD NOT SEE THAT TO HER.
SHE CERTAINLY NEEDS YOU MUCH MORE THAN I DO.
SHALL WE NOT HAVE THEM TURNED OUT.
BUT AS IT WAS THINGS SOON RIGHTED THEMSELVES.
HE WAS LATE THIS MORNING TOO.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL.
SHE COULD HAVE DONE SO.
YOU ARE HIS BEST FRIEND.
I MUST TELL YOU MORE.
I NEVER COULD TELL.
MUCH MORE THAN SISTER.
I COULD NOT HELP TELLING HER THEN.
YOU MUST DO THE BEST YOU CAN FOR ME.
I MUST BE HERE.
AS FOUR YOU YOU MUST COME.
BUT I DON'T CARE TO TAKE TALK ABOUT THAT.
NOTHING HERE IS REALLY HIS.
I ASK NO MORE THAN THAT.
THAT MUST BE RIGHT.
MY SONG MY SONG AND ALL THAT.
I SAW IT NOT.
I SAW HIM TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME.
BUT YOU MUST NOT TELL ME I SAY YOU.
I WASH I COULD GET WELL FASTER.
OF COURSE I COULD DO NOTHING.
YOU KNOW YOU MUST.
WE MUST TO HOUSE.
LEAVE IT WHERE IT'S IT'S AND BEGIN ABOUT YOURSELF.
NO SHE MUST JUST WAIT AND SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.
WHY COULD SHE NOT WET.
HE COULD HEAR NO MORE THAN BEFORE.
THERE WAS NOTHING UNDER THE EARTH.
I SEE NOTHING TO BE GLAD ABOUT.
THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE QUITE LIKE HERE.
NOW WE HAVE DONE WITH THE SUBJECT.
BUT THAT WILL BECOME OF ME POOR AND ALONE.
AND WHAT HE MOST LIKE DO WILL BE.
BUT SHE SAW IT DIFFERENT.
MUST IT PLAY ANY MORE DIS AFTERNOON.
OUR POOR LITTLE SISTER IS LOST.
WHO ELSE WAS THERE DO TO DO IT.
I SHOULD LIKE THAT BETTER.
WHAT A PLACE TO LIVE IN DIS LONDON IN WINTER.
ALL AFTERNOON NOTHING HAPPENED.
SO SHE ASKED ME WHAT I COULD DO.
ONE OF THEM MUST GIVE WAY.
WHAT WOULD SHE DO ELSE BUT LOVE HIM.
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT.
THEN IN THAT CASE I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING.
I HAD THREE OTHERS.
THE DOG SAW IT.
IT IS BETTER SO.
THERE WAS NOTHING GOOD IN IT FOR ME.
I SHALL SOON SEE.
HE HAD ALSO TO GET HIS MIND AWAY FROM HER.
AND HOW SHALL I FINISH THE TIRE.
THE PAIR WERE MARCHED AWAY.
NOTHING OUT OF THE WAY.
I THINK I HAVE NO MORE TO SAY AT PANS.
SOME OF THE MEETINGS ARE WONDERFUL.
HE WALKED AWAY SLOWLY INTO THE FUR.
LOOK AT HIM WHERE MY FRIEND.
SO SHE HAD BETTER STUDY ME.
I HOPE SAYS NOW YOU WILL LEAVE HIM.
TRY YOU LUCK THERE.
I SAW HER TAKE IT.
SAY MAY I WALK A LETTER WAY WITH YOU.
NOTHING OF THE KIND HERE SIR.
YOU FLOOR AT THAT.
HER FACE WAS POOR NOW.
YOU ARE A FINE LADY.
I SURE HE KNOWS MY ALREADY.
THE WORLD READS THEM.
BUT THEY LIKED EACH OTHER ALSO.
THE KIDS ARE GROWING UP.
WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THEM.
WELL DON'T LET HIM HAVE TOO MUCH OF IT.
PEOPLE TAKE LEAVE OF EACH OTHER.
HOW COULD IT BE.
BUT WHERE WERE THE OTHERS.
IT WAS NOT THAT SHE COLD NOT LOVE.
THE POOR MAN MUST BE IN A SAD WAY.
WE SHALL NEVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.
IT A CLEVER TRICK BUT IT WON'T HOLD WATER.
THE LIKENESS TO THE LADY IS WONDERFUL.
BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A MAN.
BUT SHALL I NOT OFTEN SEE YOU.
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT HE SHOULD BE QUIET.
THE OTHERS TURN TO HER.
IS IT ALL TOO LATE.
ONLY WE HAD BETTER GO NOW.
YES THE WALL LOOKED STRONG.
YOU WON'T HAVE HAD HIM FOR THE ASKING.
HE HAS A ROUND FACE AND TWO SMALL EYES.
WE DON'T WANT TO CARRY IT TOO FAR.
BY WHAT RIGHT DO YOU ASK.
PLAYS OFF AND ON ABOUT A COACH.
HE WAS TO BE AWAY A LONG LONG TIME.
THAT ALONE CAN MAKE A MAN OTHER THAN HE IS.
HE SHALL EAT IT.
THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL.
I AM MUCH IN LETTER.
HE COULD NOT EAT.
OH MOTHER WHAT SHALL I DO.
BUT I WILL TELL YOU.
I SHALL BE BACK BEFORE EIGHT.
MAY I NOW TAKE MY LEAVE.
WELL YOU SHALL HAVE MY STORY.
DO DO GO AWAY FOR I AM AFRAID OF YOU.
NOW DON'T YOU SEE HOW I AM FIXED.
EARLIER IN THE MORNING I WAS TO GO.
WELL AND WHAT DO YOU THINK FRIENDS.
ANOTHER MAN WAS WITH HIM.
HE COULD NOT GO ON WITH HIS WORK.
THINK OF YOUR BROTHER.
ALL OF US WANT TO FORGET SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY.
THE ROOM WAS SOON FULL OF PEOPLE.
THE HOUSE IS STRONG.
OH COULD HE NOT STAY WHERE HE WAS SAFE.
TELL THE GIRL TO PUT IT AWAY FOR YOURS TEA.
I WISH I COULD HELP.
I GUESS YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
BUT THEY MUST BE NINE ONES LIKE YOURS YOU KNOW.
I SHALL SEE YOU WHEN I WAKE.
WHERE MUST I GO.
HE LOOKED MUCH OLDER.
THE MAN WAS DIE.
AND I WAS AFRAID OF YOUR COUSIN TOO.
YOU SEE HE WANTS LAND AND WILL HAVE IT.
SHE MUST BE HUNGRY AND SHE MUST BE COLD.
I NEVER KNOW ONE OF THOSE PLACES FROM OTHER.
I DO MY HOMEWORK TOO.
WHAT SHALL WE PLAY AT.
AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE THE GAME WAS OVER.
NOTHING I SHOULD LIKE SO MUCH.
YOU WOULD NOT PAY.
I MAY BE LATE.
I MUST FIND YOU SOMETHING ELSE.
THE LITTLE MAN LOOKED AT HIM.
I SHALL NOT RUN AGAIN.
SHE COULD NOT TELL HOW LONG HE HAD TO LIVE.
BUT YOU CAN MAKE HER A LADY.
HE TURNED TO THE OTHERS.
NO ONE COULD SEE IT.
BUT I'M GLAD YOU WILL SEE ME AS I AM.
BUT AT PRESENT THERE ARE THINGS WHICH MUST BE DONE.
HE HAS FOLLOWED ME HERE TO DO IT.
THEY MUST FIND A ROOM FOR ME.
I MUST HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT.
HOW LATE IT IS.
NOTHING IS LEFT TO ME.
BUT I SAW MUCH.
BUT WE KNOW NOTHING OF HIM.
BUT WHAT COULD I SAY.
I'LL TELL MY MOTHER.
THE HOURS PASSED BY.
THAT OLD WOMAN CAN FOLLOW.
HIS KIND WILL COME FIRST AND BETTER ONES AFTER.
NOT OFTENER THAN I CAN HELP.
THAT'S WHAT I FEEL SO STRONG YOU KNOW.
SHE HAD HER HANDS FULL JUST THEN.
HE NOW HAD BOTH EYES WIDE OPEN.
SHE NEED SAY NOTHING.
HE PLAYS A PART.
THERE IS NO HIGH LAND NEAR.
WHY DOES HE WRITE TO ME ABOUT THE WOOD.
THESE WERE ALL LITTLE GIRLS.
MONTHS AND MONTHS PASSED AWAY WITHOUT ANY CHANGE.
WON'T YOU STAY AND HAVE SUPPER WITH ME.
THEN HE WOULD BEGIN TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FUTURE.
THERE HE KNOCKED AND ASKED FOR A PIECE OF BREAD.
AH I DON'T LIKE THAT OTHER WORLD.
I AM VERY SORRY FOR ASKING YOU.
THEY HAD LEFT THE PALACE TOGETHER THAT EVENING.
HE WOULD GIVE JACK A DRINK.
PAY ME SOME TIME.
IN THE OTHER COUNTRY COULD IT BE DONE AT ALL.
BUT IT'S ONLY OUTSIDE HE'S OLD.
OF COURSE YOU MUST GO AS YOU PLEASE.
TAKE HERE AND NO SMALL PART SHOULD BE THEIR.
HE WOMAN FOLLOW HIM UP THE SERE.
IT WAS BETTER TO GET IT OFF.
I ASKED AS WE AS WE LEFT THE OFFICE.
I KNOW NOTHING OF PARTIES.
BUT I COULD NOT KEEP QUIET.
SHALL I SHOW YOU WHERE THE PEACH IS.
I MUST SEEN WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.
IT WAS SOME ONE ELSE.
WE WALKED FOR AN HOUR.
I I SAW HIM MORE THAN ANGRY NOW.
I'M NOT SO BAD AS ALL THAT.
SHE HAS A LITTLE MONEY.
DOES HE TREAT YOU WHERE.
WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE.
I THINK YOU DID NOT LIKE HIS PARENTS.
IT WAS SUCH AS A WONDERFUL DAY FOR ME.
OLD MEN LIKE MYSELF YOU CARE NOTHING ABOUT.
I AM QUITE SURE I DID NOT.
ONLY LAST WEEK I WAS ASKED TO COME HERE.
SHE HAD OWNED IT AT LAST.
WHAT WILL HAPPENED NEXT I WONDER.
IS SHE YOUNG AND PRETTY.
YOU HAVE HAD IF OF OUR QUIET LIFE A READY.
I WAS ANGRY WHEN I WROTE THEM.
I WONDER WHERE THE POOR LADY LEFT IT.
BUT WONDER OF WONDERS.
HE LOOKED VERY HIGH OVER HER HEAD.
AND HOW ABOUT YOUR DAD LAST NIGHT.
BUT AS SUCH SHE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF HIM.
THE COWS NEVER GAVE SO MUCH MILK AS THAT NIGHT.
I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND ENTERED.
BUT HE DID NOT MIND IT.
AND THESE MEN WOULD LET HER GO AGAIN.
DID HE LOVE HER.
TO BE SURE YOU DID.
THIS IS WHAT ALL MEN DO.
SHE SAID SHE WOULD SEE HER.
IN THE EVENING I WENT AGAIN WHEN I SAW HIM.
BUT I FOUND HER OUT AT LAST.
LOVE HIM HE DID NO AND COULD NOT.
BUT THE TWO DID NO FIT.
NO USE STANDING HER.
THESE THINGS AND MANY OTHERS INTERESTED HER.
THE LOVERS WERE ALL AROUND ABOUT IT.
I WONDER WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE.
WE WENT OUT TO SEE HIM.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WILL MEAN.
BELL AS THEIR TRUE MAN OF THEIR TIME.
WHY THEY HAVE LOST THEIR HANDS.
SHE WAS MORE THAN HIS MUCH.
BUT THERE IS NO CRY OF HELPING.
AND HE HELD ALL THE HAND.
BUT IN THE NAME OF WONDER WHY.
THE MAN TOLD WILLING FOR HIS OTHERS.
THAT IS WHAT MR WRIGHT ASKS.
AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER.
WHAT DID I KNOW OF LIFE THEN.
DID HE LEAVE THEM HERE.
SAY SHALL IT BE HERE OR WHERE THEY ARE STANDING.
BUT THEY CAN'T LAST.
THEY DID NOT SEE THEM ANY MORE.
SO I WENT AWAY AND SAID NOTHING.
SHE MUST BE MADE TO STAY.
I CALLED THIS ONE IN AND GAVE HIM HIS SUPPER.
PUSHING THE DOOR OPEN I ENTERED.
NO WONDER EVERY ONE HAS STOPPED TO LOOK.
AT ALL EVENTS I WANT TO TRY.
AS HE WENT HE CALLED OUT FOR HELP.
DID I PLEASE YOU.
THESE MEN DO NOT RETURN.
BUT ANOTHER GOT THE PLACE.
SHE DID NOT CRY AT ALL.
THE CHILDREN STOOD BACK.
AND WHAT DID THEY SEE.
WHAT WOULD SHE DO UNDER THIS BE.
THEIR FACES WERE SET HARD.
DO YOU BELIEVE WE SHALL.
LAUGH AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE.
SOME SEEMED TO STAY HIS HAND.
THE THING WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME.
I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF SUCH A FRIEND AS YOU.
WHY DO YOU HOLD SUCH LANGUAGE.
IF SHE LOVES ME HE WILL READ MY WISHES.
AND ALL UP AND DOWN THE ROADS EVERYBODY LIKES ME.
NOW WILL YOU PLEASE SIT QUIRT STILL.
SHE IS TALKING IN HER SLEEP.
THE SECOND WAS A YEAR LATER.
COME I WILL BE ANSWERED.
STILL YOU MUST HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY.
I KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT YOUR AGE.
HIS OLD SISTER COULD NOT BELIEVE IT.
DO YOU PROMISE TO DO THIS.
OUR TEMPLE STAIRS ARE RATHER DARK.
FAR BETTER NOW WERE THERE IS STILL TIME.
I COULDN'T THINK OF SUCH A THING.
I'M READY FOR THE MARCH.
SO SHE HE WANTED IT EXPLAINED TO HIM.
THAT EVENING SHE SHOWED HER LETTER TO HER FATHER.
NOT FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.
YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE THIS DAY.
GO DOWN AND FACE THEM LIKE A MAN.
THAT WOULD BE SAME THING SEEMING TO KNOW TOO MUCH.
I ONLY WANTED YOU TO BEAT.
IT SEEMS TO STAND OUT.
I SHALL YET PUT MY FINGER ON THIS MAN.
COME DEAR PUT ON YOUR HAT.
WHY CANNOT SHE LIKE AN HONEST MAN WHO LIKES HER.
AND OF COURSE EVERYBODY THINKS THE SAME.
YOU WOULD PUT YOURSELF BETWEEN ME AND SONG.
IT SEEMS SUCH A VERY LONG TIME.
THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER FOR A MOMENT.
BECAUSE HIS SON WAS GOING TO BE KILLED.
WELL I WILL RING FOR HIM.
THEY ARE A LAZY SIT.
BE QUIET FOR A MOMENT.
AS FOR MODERN FRIENDSHIP IT'S WILL BE FOUND IN CLASS.
HAVE I WORRIED YOU PERSONALLY.
I AM GOING TO THE WAR.
YOU WILL NOT GET THE HANDSOME LOOKS.
BUT YET I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING WANTING.
YOU GO IN AND ASK HER IF SHE DO.
WHAT A PITY YOU HAVE HAD YOUR BREAKFAST.
I AM I MUST BE DEAR TO YOU.
AS IF HE COULD FORGET HIM.
BUT I HAD TO FIGHT FOR IT I HAD.
YET WHY THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING IS HARD TO SAY.
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THIS IS TRUE.
IT WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT LINE OF THOUGHT.
HE SPEAKS OF A BLOW.
I SHALL BE READY TO ACT.
HOW LONG DO YOU SLEEP BY THE WAY.
YOUR TIME IS NOT YET COME.
YOU ARE AMONG FRIENDS AND IN GOOD HANDS.
SO OF THE NATIONS WITH THEIR WARS.
AND DOWN I GO FOR THE TENTH TIME.
IN THIS CASE WHAT A WAR.
NOW ANOTHER THING I WANT TO TELL YOU.
TELL HIM THAT CHANGE WILL BE HIS BEST MEDICINE.
I HAVE NEVER HAD TO HIDE FROM ANYBODY.
YET YOU STILL HAVE MEETINGS.
I THINK THAT I AM NEAR THE END OF IT.
AND LOOK WHAT A VIEW.
IF THE THING WAS TRUE IT WAS TERRIBLE.
THIS HAD BETTER BE THE END OF IT.
I WASH I COULD SLEEP.
THERE IS SO LITTLE REAL FRIENDSHIP IN THE WORLD.
HERE WAS THE ONE THING SHE HAD TO DO NOW.
HE PUT THE THING BACK INTO THE DRIVER.
WE HAD A LETTER FROM HIM THIS MORNING.
THERE WAS NO EXCEPTION TO HIS RULE.
IT WOULD BE FUNNY SO FUNNY.
HE TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED UP THE ROAD.
COME BACK HERE A MOMENT.
THAT IS TO SAY I'M GOING TO SLEEP.
SO PREPARE FOR THIS VERY VERY NIGHT.
IT WAS ONLY ONE BY THE PAST THAT MORNING.
I MUST FIND OUT LATER ON.
HAD THE MOMENT REALLY COME.
I KNOW THAT MY DEAR BOY.
I'M NOT GOOD WITHOUT MY CUP OF TEA MY DEAR.
HE MAY BE ABLE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
THERE WAS SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US.
LOOK NOW AT THE PATH BELOW US.
AND IN THAT YOU ANSWERED ME.
THE REPORT MAY BE THIS TIME TRAIN.
THIS DESK IS YOUR ROCK SIR.
I ASK YOU IS SUCH A MAN FREE.
HE WOULD NOT KEEP YOU MORE THAN A MOMENT.
HOW BIG IS YOUR HOUSE.
NOW WELL I REMEMBER EVERY MOMENT OF THE CENSE.
IF I GIVE THE WORD YOU STAY ON.
I AS A WOMAN THINK DIFFERENTLY.
I BELIEVE IN THE FIGHT WHICH IS IN EVERYTHING.
HE SEEMED A VERY GOOD WOMAN NEAR FIFTY YEARS GOOD.
IS THIS ANYTHING TO ME.
YOU ARE NO LONGER KIND.
EVEN THIS IS MORE THAN WE CAN SAY.
OF COURSE THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE QUESTION.
WILL YOU BE READY AT ONCE NOW.
THEY HAD TO SUPPORT HIM AND PUT HIM TO BED.
I MADE MY VOICE SOUNDS CARELESS.
AMERICA'S GOING THROUGH JUST ABOUT THE SAME EXPERIENCE AS MYSELF.
AND NOW YOU EXPECT THAT SHE SHOULD DO SO.
THINK OF ME AS THROUGH I WERE YOU SISTER.
HE IS WORSE THAN LAST YEAR.
DO YOU REALLY AND TRULY SAY SO.
I SHALL DO MY PARKING.
NOW LET ME HAVE YOUR ATTENTION.
THESE WERE NOT THE ALL MOST IMPORTANT THING HOWEVER.
IT WAS AS STILL AS DEATH.
CAN I TRUST MY OWN EARS.
IF NOT WE MUST BREAK IT OFF.
THE NAMES REMAINING WERE CALLED IN THE SAME MANNER.
I'LL DO NOTHING UNTIL I HAVE READ THE ANSWER.
HE IS BURNING TO HAVE AT SOMEBODY.
IT WANTS WHOLE BOAT TO ITSELF.
ENGLISH LIFE IN THEM THERE WAS NONE.
HE SENDS ME FOR THAT PURPOSE AND HERE I AM.
SHE TRY AND SHE SUCCEED.
WE NEED NOT STAY UNLESS YOU LIKE.
BUT ENGLISH ARE FOOLS.
IF YOU MAKE ANY NOISE WE ARE LOST.
HE IS RICH MAN.
HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD WAIT FOR HIS RETURN.
IF YOU NOT MORE THAN TEN I WILL MAKE FIGHT.
BUT YOU HAD BEST WASTE NO TIME ON QUESTIONS.
HOWEVER YOU CAN PUT IT ON NOW.
THERE SEEMED A WALL IN FRONT OF HIM.
SHOULD HE EVER SEE HER AGAIN.
COVERED WITH SHAME SHE COULD MAKE NO ANSWER.
OTHER FURNITURE THERE WAS NONE.
WE WERE ONCE MORE AT HOME.
EACH MAN HAD A PIECE OF SOAP AND A TOWEL.
COME IT WOULD GIVE ME SO MUCH PLEASURE.
THE LAST STAGE WAS REACHED.
SHE IS SO GENTLE AND SWEET.
IF ANY MAN EVER LOVED A GIRL SHE LOVED YOU.
BECAUSE EVEN NOW THINGS MIGHT TURN OUT DIFFERENTLY.
THERE IS OUR STARTING POINT.
THAT WAS THE REASON OF HIS GOING.
THE SHOCK WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM.
I HAD NOT THE HEART TO KILL HER.
AND THE WHOLE COURT WAS PLACED UNDER HIS ORDERS.
I LIFTED MY HEAD AND KISSED HER.
I WOULD TRUST HIM AS I COULD TRUST MYSELF.
YOU WIN THE PRIZE YOU SEE.
MAYBE A LOT OF PEOPLE.
YOU HAVE NO NEED TO TROUBLE YOURSELF TO COME.
YOU START A QUESTION AND IT'S LIKE STARTING A STONE.
SHE SENDS YOUR HER REGARD.
THEN THIS WAS THE SECRET OF IT ALL.
AND I WOULD HAVE KISSED YOU.
ITS BEAUTY IS THE BEAUTY OF HIS OWN MIND.
I SEE YOU ALL SWING IN A ROPE.
HE IS TRULY A GOOSE AND NOT A DUCK.
I WONDER IF SATURDAY WILL EVER COME.
YES YOU WILL SEE HERE HAVE SPEECH WITH HERE.
THREE WERE HAS BAD HAS HIMSELF.
WHERE YOU NOT ABLE TO BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM.
SHE WANTS TO ASK YOU HERSELF.
SOMETHING TERRIBLE WAS IN PREPARATION.
DO YOU EVER TRY ME.
AS LONG AS YOU FIND ME WORK I WILL REMAIN.
BECAUSE I SEE YOUR BODY ACTING IN A CERTAIN WAY.
I TURNED MY EYES ROUND AS FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE.
WOULD THE GENTLEMAN STATE HIS BUSINESS PLEASE.
LAST TIME I WAS YOUR JEST.
SHALL YOU STATE AT ONCE.
HERE IS AN INSTANCE OF THIS FEELING.
I SAVED MY CHICKENS THROUGH.
DEATH IS ONLY A RETURN HIM AFTER ALL.
THERE MUST BE AN END OF THIS.
NOTHING REMAINS FOR US BUT WAIT AND HOPE.
HE CAN ALMOST STAND ON HIS LEGS.
I WISH I HAD NONE BUT MY OWN TO TELL.
BE SEATED IF YOU PLEASE SIR.
SHE WALKED THROUGH THE HOUSE.
ALL OTHER TIME IS PEACE.
BUT MIGHT NOT HE GET ANOTHER LESSON FROM THEM.
SHE BELONGED TO HIM AND HE TO HER.
BUT AT DINNER THERE WERE PLANS TO BE MADE.
WHAT A GREATLY IT WAS.
BUT THAT WOULD NOT ALONE EXPLAIN HIS PLEASURE.
HE WAS FOR MOMENTS TURNED TO STONE BEFORE IT.
BUT WHAT CAN BE THEIR AM.
I HAVE HOWEVER FOUND THE FOLLOWING.
HE SEEMED TO BE TALKING TO HIMSELF.
BUT WHAT IS THE POINT OF IT.
IF IT BE ON THE FINGER TAKE THE FINGER OFF.
HE REACHED OVER AND TOUCHED HER HAND.
HE COULD PAY NO ATTENTION.
HE HAD ALMOST LOST HER.
I KNOW THAT WAS UNDERSTANDING.
I WANT THE TRUTH THE TRUTH.
EVERYTHING IS AN EVENT AT SEA.
AND THERE IS WORSE BEHIND.
I SAW THE KEY WAS IN THE LOCK OUTSIDE.
HE SITS BY HER SIDE FOR HOURS.
WHAT CARE I IF SHE SHE SINK OR SWIM.
WHO WOULD EVER WANT ONE OF THIS COLLECTION.
SO FAR THEY WERE IN PERFECT AGREEMENT.
THE LIFT HAD STOPPED AT THEIR FLOOR.
AM I WORSE THAN YOU.
HE DRESSED IT HIMSELF TWICE A DAY.
DO ANYTHING BUT COME DOWNSTAIRS WITH ME.
FROM THE COURT THE NEWS SOON REACHED THE TOWN.
WE ARE BUT YOUNG ONCE.
IT IS ALWAYS SAFE TO TRUST HIM.
WOULD YOU EAT YOUR CAKE TWICE.
HE SIGNED TO HER TO LISTEN.
ALL THE SAME YOU MUST NOT REMAIN HERE.
WE MIGHT PICK UP SOME POINTS.
AND THAT MAKES IT WORSE.
I THINK WE MAY EXPECT HIM BEFORE MORNING.
I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF HIS DEATH.
SHE WAS JUST IN TIME TO HEAR THE DIRECTION.
IT WOULD HAVE SPARED ME ALL THIS WORRY.
IF THIS WERE TRUE WHO COULD BE UNHAPPY.
I SHALL NEVER GETS THE ANY INTEREST FOR MY MONEY.
THERE ARE NONE SUCH IN THIS PARTY.
WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO HIDE YOU.
THE SECOND WAS RATHER LESS SIMPLE BUT NOT MUCH LONGER.
AND THEIR END WAS THE SAME.
PUT THESE CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE HER FROM ME THEN.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SURE THAT HE WAS GUILTY.
WEIGH THE OFFERS THEY WILL MAKE YOU.
BUT THIS IS ASKING FOR THE WORLD AND NOTHING LESS.
HE BOWED AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM.
SEE THEM AND HEAR WHAT THEY CAN ADD.
IT IS YOUR DUTY MY SON.
I THINK THAT SHE HAD NO CAUSE TO LEAVE ME.
SHE IS A GIRL WITH A LOT OF TALENT.
I SHALL PUT HIM IN THE ADVERTISEMENT THIS TIME.
THIS MESSAGE GIVES ME HOPE.
THERE WAS NO WAY SHE COULD USE IT.
HE PUT DOWN HIS STERN AND LOOKED AGAIN.
SHE OPENED HER EYES STARING UP AT HIM.
BUT HE CAN DO THINGS BUT THIS.
I WONDER THAT WE WERE STILL SO LONG.
YOU MAY NOT WANT TO KNOW.
SO HE CALLED AND ASKED ONE MORE TIME.
AND THEN THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO.
SHE TURNED AWAY FROM ME AND SUDDENLY BACK.
THAT YOU LOVE ME AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU.
IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH IF THEY HAD ONLY THOUGHT.
WHAT HE SAW ABOUT HER THAT MADE HER SPECIAL.
I TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK THE DOG OVER.
HE IS THE BEST COOK IN THE WORLD TOO.
THE OTHER WAS A GIRL AS WELL.
THEY WALKED THE REST OF THE DAY AND ALL NIGHT.
SOMEWHERE THERE HAD TO BE A PLACE BETTER THAN THIS.
HE SHRUGGED ME OFF LIKE I WAS NOTHING.
IT IS NOT THE FACE HE KNOWS THOUGH.
YOU FEEL LIKE A LITTLE BROTHER TO ME.
YOU MUST NOT THINK OF THE PAST NOW.
SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD NEVER COME HERE.
THEY WERE ALREADY IN AND SEEMED LIKE THEY SAW NOTHING.
THE SAME LOOK OF CONFUSION IS ON HIS FACE.
THERE WAS NO WAY WE COULD GET OUT.
BUT STILL I WOULD DO MY BEST.
SO THIS WAS ALL OVER HIM.
AND THERE SHE WAS WITH ANOTHER MAN.
I KNOW YOU JUST AS WELL AS YOU KNOW YOURSELF.
IT WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT.
SHE HAVE TO MAKE UP THINGS IF EVER.
SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND THOUGHT BACK.
WE TALKED ALL NIGHT AGAIN ABOUT THIS AND THAT.
WHAT WAS THERE AFTER THIS WHICH HE MIGHT NOT DO.
HE REACHED FOR HER HAND SHE LET HIM TAKE IT.
I SUPPOSE IT IS BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD TELL ME.
THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT WERE LOOKING AT US.
HE WATCHES ME DAY IN AND DAY OUT.
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW MY FATHER.
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE WITH THEM OR BE LEFT BEHIND.
SHE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH ONE OF THE HORSE.
BUT HOW COULD SHE HAVE NOT KNOWN THAT.
ACTUALLY THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO FOR ME.
HE PULLED IT OUT AND LOOKED AT IT.
SHOULD I KNOW HER AGAIN IF I SAW HER.
AND THEN HE HAD A BETTER IDEA.
COULD THIS GIRL BE LIKE HIM IN SOME WAY.
IT WAS STILL ON HIS BACK.
WE ALL WERE A LITTLE.
SHE JUST NEVER WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT EVEN NOW.
I MADE UP MY MIND TO GO AT ONCE.
NONE OF THEM HAD THOUGHT TO LOOK BEHIND THE DOOR.
IF SO WHAT WAS IT.
THIS TIME I WAS RIGHT.
HE TURNED HIS HEAD AWAY FROM HER.
I ACTUALLY THINK WE MIGHT MAKE IT OUT OF THIS.
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR ME.
WHAT KIND OF PERSON WOULD SHE COME TO BE.
IT WAS WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG.
I ASKED TO BE SURE.
SHE SAW IT ALL IN A MOMENT.
I WANT TO SEE HIM MYSELF.
THERE WAS REALLY NO WINNING WITH HER WAS THERE.
AND THEN SOMETHING KNOCKED ME OUT OF THE WAY.
HE HAD THOUGHT THEY WOULD NEVER COME BACK.
BUT WHAT TRICK DO YOU HAVE FOR US NOW.
IT IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN.
I LOOKED OVER AT THEM.
IF SHE WANTED TO SHE COULD BE VERY POPULAR.
THEY HAD TO LET GO.
BUT WE LOOKED LIKE THAT A LONG LONG TIME AGO.
HE TURNED AROUND AND WALKED AWAY TO THE PLATFORM.
I AM A PLAIN MAN AND SAY WHAT I THINK.
THIS WAS THE PLACE ALL RIGHT.
HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE IT FROM HERE.
HE WAS STILL AT HOME.
HE ASKED HER ONE DAY.
SHE HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAT NIGHT.
HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THE GIRL.
BUT THAT IS AT AN END.
SHE WAS JUST LIKE HE WAS.
THEN ON OUT THE BACK DOOR OF THE HOUSE.
HE LOOKED HERE AND THERE.
YOU MAY NOT BE WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE.
BUT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING HAD MESSED UP.
AND ONCE MORE SHE WAS ALL HIS OWN.
IT NEVER HAPPENED AND IT NEVER WILL.
THEY ALL GIVE THEM TO HIM.
THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY AROUND IT.
THIS WAS THE THING SHE WANTED TO HEAR ONLY THIS.
WE ARE GOING TO DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.
NO DOUBT HE WAS VERY GOOD AND ALL THAT.
SHE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN.
HE TURNED AND ASKED THEM.
HE WAS TALENTED IN MORE THINGS THAN I WAS.
SHE WAS LOOKING AWAY FROM HIM AT THE FIRE.
SO THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO BE CALLED.
AND EVEN AFTER THAT IT IS NOT MUCH BETTER.
I LEFT THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF HIM.
NOW SHE HAD TO DO THE SAME.
AND SHE WAS INTIMATE WITH HIM AS AT FIRST.
IT IS OVER IN A MOMENT.
THEY WERE ON MY SIDE OF THE STREAM NOW.
HE COULD NEVER SEE HER BEFORE.
YOU STILL NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT CAN BE THERE.
THERE WAS A MAN BEHIND ME.
THAT WAS JUST HOW SHE WAS.
THIS IS THE WAY OF LIFE.
AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING ON HER MIND.
I WANTED TO FIND MORE OUT ABOUT YOU.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS A GOOD PERSON.
WE COULD PUT YOU IN A WORLD OF HURT.
BUT NOT VERY LONG WAS SHE LEFT IN DOUBT.
SHE LET GO OF HIS HAND AND RUBBED HER EYES.
I JUST WANT TO SEE HER SAFE IN YOUR HANDS.
BUT HERE IT IS THAT I MUST MAKE MY CONFESSION.
AND THEN THERE WAS AN END OF IT.
I ASKED NOT EVEN LOOKING UP AT HIM.
HE HAD CALLED THEM THAT HIMSELF IN HIS DAY.
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE.
HE LOOKED BACK AT ME.
SHE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT.
THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE SHE WANTED BY HER SIDE.
BUT WHAT IF WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS RIGHT.
IT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE.
I AM NOT GOING OUT WITH YOU.
THIS WAS NO TIME TO THINK ABOUT THE REAL WORLD.
I TURNED TO FACE THEM.
BUT IT CAN DO SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.
THEN THEY WERE AT THE SAME THING AGAIN.
HE CLOSED HIS EYES AS HE WALKED.
I ASKED IF THEY WERE IN A FIGHT OR SOMETHING.
NO NO HE WAS TOO GOOD A WORKMAN FOR THAT.
HE PUT HER DOWN AND PATTED HER ON THE HEAD.
WE WOULD HAVE TO FIND SOME WAY OF HIDING IT.
I HAD LEFT IT BEHIND.
SHE TURNED AWAY WITH A LITTLE WAVE OF THE HAND.
BUT LOOK AT YOU TWO.
WHAT WAS HE LIKE IN PERSON.
HE LOOKED AT ME AND SMILED AND I SMILED BACK.
SHE WANTED TO GET OUT.
IT WAS JUST A PERSON.
THIS WAS WHERE SHE HAD LEFT THEM.
THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HIM TOO.
WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE THEN.
THE TIME OF THE DAY.
I COULD NOW SEE INTO HIS FACE.
AND I NEVER THOUGHT A THING.
THEY STOPPED AND HE WAS LET GO.
I LOOK DOWN AND KNOW THE MAN IS DEAD.
HOW LONG WAS HE GOING TO BE HERE.
THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT FROM SIDE TO SIDE.
THEN SHE TURNED TO ALL OF US.
THAT WOULD MEAN THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE IT OVER.
I WAS TIRED AND HAD OTHER THINGS ON MY MIND.
WE MUST THINK OF THE GOOD AND NOT THE EVIL.
NO IT WAS THE EYES.
HE PUT HIS HAND ON THE KNOB AND OPENED IT.
I STILL HAD NO IDEA WHO HE WAS.
I LOOKED OVER AT HIM.
IT WAS JUST YOU LAST TIME.
THERE IS NO WAY I CAN GET BY THIS.
BUT HOW WOULD THEY GO ABOUT IT.
THEY ALL SMILED AT THE WORLD AROUND THEM.
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COME WITH US NOW.
NOW THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO.
HE THEN WALKED FROM THERE OUT OF THAT ROOM.
HE HAD NOTHING BUT THIS PLACE.
HE STILL COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING.
WE HAD TO MAKE IT.
I NEED TO BE HERE.
I SEEMED TO BE THE FIRST ONE DOWN.
I HAD TO FIND A DIFFERENT BACK DOOR.
HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY.
I PUT MY HAND ON IT.
IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE WHO IT WAS.
THAT ALL I CAN EVER BE.
AND THERE WAS AN END OF IT.
HE WAS MORE THAN JUST A FATHER.
HE WAS GOING TO HELP HIM.
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THIS.
SHE SMILED AT THE TIME.
THEN IT WOULD ALL BE OVER.
THAT HE COULD HAVE A HOME AGAIN.
THERE WAS ONE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.
BUT THEY WERE TURNED TO HIS LEFT.
I THOUGHT FOR SURE SHE WOULD SAY SOMETHING.
I WALKED UP TO MY ROOM.
I CAN GET HER BACK.
THE BOY LOOKED FROM THE HAND TO HER.
HE SAW THE DAY WHEN IT HAD ALL HAPPENED.
SHE ASKED LOOKING UP AT ME.
I MADE IT TO HER HOUSE.
I WAS STILL FOR A MOMENT.
THIS WAS THE WAY IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE.
SHE STOPPED WHERE SHE WAS AND LOOKED AROUND.
AND THE FIRST THOUGH IN MY HEAD WAS.
AND THAT WAS THE LAST I EVER SAW OF HIM.
IT WAS NOT YET TIME.
HE COULD BUT WHAT WOULD HE DO.
SHE SMILED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY.
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN FRONT OF HER.
IT WILL ONLY BE A MOMENT.
THE WOMAN LOOKED UP TO HIM.
THIS IS ALL I CAN SAY.
BUT THE EYES WERE RIGHT.
HE TURNED HIS HEAD TO LOOK AT THEM.
I HAVE BETTER GET OUT OF HERE.
AND THEN THERE WAS HER FACE.
HE ALWAYS SAW IF SHE WANTED HIM NOT TO.
I THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS ABOUT TO END.
WHAT WOULD THEY BE LIKE TO WORK WITH.
NOW ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME GO.
I PUT THEM BACK ON AND LEFT.
THAT WAS AS MUCH AS HE WOULD GIVE HER.
THEY OPENED IT AND WALKED IN.
I THINK IT WILL DO US ALL SOME GOOD.
THE THING HAD COME AND SO IT MUST BE.
HE WAS NEVER EVEN IN THE ROOM.
HE LOOKED AT HER AND TURNED AWAY.
I WILL FIND THEM FOR YOU.
IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE ONE PERSON.
THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE.
YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME.
I WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT.
THEY HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE.
THIS WAS NOT IN HIS MIND.
WE WERE THE SAME I OPENED MY EYES.
BUT HOW CAN SHE TELL WHO IT WAS.
I JUST WANT HER BACK.
THE GIRL WALKED IN AND LOOKED AROUND.
HE WAS ALWAYS UP TO NO GOOD.
IT WAS ONLY ONE AFTER ALL I SAY.
THAT DAY WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM.
AS IF TO BE BUT A MAN WERE NOTHING.
BUT THEN AGAIN THIS WAS HER HOUSE.
HE WAS NOT HARD TO SEE FROM WHERE SHE WAS.
I DO LOVE YOU AND I CAN MAKE THINGS RIGHT.
IT WAS AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FRONT DOOR.
THERE IS NO END TO THIS IS THERE.
SHE WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM.
IT SHOULD AS HE WAS ONE AFTER ALL.
AND SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON LEFT.
THE OTHER AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.
I WILL FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.
HE ASKED IF I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MY FATHER.
IT MADE ME WANT TO GET AWAY FROM HIM.
I COULD NEVER GIVE YOU UP.
IF IT BE SO I HAD BETTER GO.
I PUT THEM ON AND I SAW WHERE WE WERE.
I AM SURE YOU CAN DO IT.
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME TO YOU.
AND YOU COME BEFORE THAT.
BUT THEN I THOUGHT THERE WAS LITTLE NEED.
BUT NOW I SEE WHO YOU REALLY ARE.
IT WAS NOT HER PLACE TO SAY ANYTHING.
I COULD FEEL HER EYES LOOKING AT ME.
I LOOKED OVER TO THE SIDE.
SHE TURNED TO FACE THE MAN.
WAS IT POSSIBLE TO INTERPRET THEM TO ANY USEFUL PURPOSE.
NOT A LIVING CREATURE WAS VISIBLE.
AND AFTER HE LEFT I FEEL EMPTY.
THE RECEIVER HAD NOT SUFFERED AT ALL.
WE WILL TAKE TURNS IN WRITING EACH CHAPTER.
DEATH SHOULD BE VEILED THE GRAVE SHOULD HAVE ITS RESERVE.
THEY WERE SILVER WITH NO PUPIL.
TOO LONG TOO SHORT TOO BORING.
TROOPS ARE MARCHING INTO BATTLE.
WAITING FOR WHAT SHE THOUGHT.
HER EYES USUALLY SO GENTLE FLASHED FIRE.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME MY FRIEND.
THAT'S WHY WE BOTH PASSED OUT.
AUTHOR NOTE HELLO AGAIN EVERYONE.
EVERY MINUTE SEEMED LIKE AN HOURS.
ALL HEADS TURNED THEIR WAY.
BUT THIS WANTS FARTHER EXPLANATION.
MY OWN OWN DARLING DARLING DARLING JEWEL.
YOU MAY CONTINUE GUN TRAINING.
IT'S ALMOST PAST YOUR BED TIME.
AT THIS SHE LAUGHED AND SEEMED QUITE SATISFIED.
A THIRD FINISHED WELL THERE YOU HAVE IT.
THIS WAS LIKE STRIKING THEIR FLAG.
BOTH GIRLS CALLED OUT AS THEY WATCHED HER LEAVE.
WERE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE EVIL.
YOU CAN JUMP WITHOUT ME.
IF THAT EVER HAPPENS THAT IS.
NOTHING BUT AN IMMENSE SEA.
THEY WERE PROBABLY DATING OR SOMETHING HE SHRUGGED.
WOMAN NO IT'S ALL RIGHT.
EXTREMELY LONG TIME NO WRITE.
THE FIRST MAY BE THUS EXPLAINED.
HOW MANY KINGDOMS KNOW US NOT.
AN AREA FILLED WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS.
ANYWAY THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.
MY FATHER'S VOICE SOUNDED TENSE.
MAYBE WE SHOULD GET SOME CAKE.
MORE THAN USUAL AT ANY RATE.
HER MIND STARTED FORGETTING EVERYTHING.
HIS HEAD HURT EVEN WORSE.
